        <tr id="In cancer, complex genome rearrangements and other structural alterations, including the amplification of oncogenes on circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) elements, drive the formation and progression of tumors. ecDNA is a particularly challenging structural alteration. By untethering oncogenes from chromosomal constraints, it elevates oncogene copy number, drives intratumoral genetic heterogeneity, promotes rapid tumor evolution, and results in treatment resistance. The profound changes in DNA shape and nuclear architecture generated by ecDNA alter the transcriptional landscape of tumors by catalyzing new types of regulatory interactions that do not occur on chromosomes. The current suite of tools for interrogating cancer genomes is well suited for deciphering sequence but has limited ability to resolve the complex changes in DNA structure and dynamics that ecDNA generates. Here, we review the challenges of resolving ecDNA form and function and discuss the emerging tool kit for deciphering ecDNA architecture and spatial organization, including what has been learned to date about how this dramatic change in shape alters tumor development, progression, and drug resistance. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics, Volume 23 is October 2022.

        <tr id="Human genes are arranged on 23 pairs of chromosomes, but in cancer, tumor-promoting genes and regulatory elements can free themselves from chromosomes and relocate to circular, extrachromosomal pieces of DNA (ecDNA). ecDNA, because of its nonchromosomal inheritance, drives high-copy-number oncogene amplification and enables tumors to evolve their genomes rapidly. Furthermore, the circular ecDNA architecture fundamentally alters gene regulation and transcription, and the higher-order organization of ecDNA contributes to tumor pathogenesis. Consequently, patients whose cancers harbor ecDNA have significantly shorter survival. Although ecDNA was first observed more than 50 years ago, its critical importance has only recently come to light. In this review, we discuss the current state of understanding of how ecDNAs form and function as well as how they contribute to drug resistance and accelerated cancer evolution.

        <tr id="Extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) are prevalent in human cancers and mediate high oncogene expression through elevated copy number and altered gene regulation1. Gene expression typically involves distal enhancer DNA elements that contact and activate genes on the same chromosome2,3. Here we show that ecDNA hubs, comprised of ~10-100 ecDNAs clustered in the nucleus of interphase cells, drive intermolecular enhancer input for amplified oncogene expression. Single-molecule sequencing, single-cell multiome, and 3D enhancer connectome reveal subspecies of MYC-PVT1 ecDNAs lacking enhancers that access intermolecular and ectopic enhancer-promoter interactions in ecDNA hubs. ecDNA hubs persist without transcription and are tethered by BET protein BRD4. BET inhibitor JQ1 disperses ecDNA hubs, preferentially inhibits ecDNA oncogene transcription, and kills ecDNA+ cancer cells. Two amplified oncogenes MYC and FGFR2 intermix in ecDNA hubs, engage in intermolecular enhancer-promoter interactions, and transcription is uniformly sensitive to JQ1. Thus, ecDNA hubs are nuclear bodies of many ecDNAs tethered by proteins and platforms for cooperative transcription, leveraging the power of oncogene diversification and combinatorial DNA interactions. We suggest ecDNA hubs, rather than individual ecDNAs, as units of oncogene function, cooperative evolution, and new targets for cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Structural variants (SVs) represent a mechanism by which cancer cells activate oncogenes or disrupt the function of genes with tumor suppressor roles. A recent study by the PCAWG Consortium investigated structural variants in 30 tumor types, identifying focal rearrangements in the oncogenic BRD4 gene in ovarian, endometrial and breast cancers. These rearrangements resulted in decreased BRD4 expression despite increased copy number, suggesting a novel mechanism to finetune gene over-expression. In this study, we show that focal deletions of BRD4 disrupt genomic regulatory regions and impact gene isoform expression in breast and ovarian tumors when compared to their expression across normal tissues. To determine the functional impact of these concomitant amplification and focal deletion events, we first leveraged open-reading-frame (ORF) screen data from 16 cancer cell lines, where we observed that overexpression of BRD4-long and BRD4-short isoforms is toxic for cancer cell growth. We confirmed these results in OVSAHO ovarian cancer cells, where overexpression of both isoforms significantly reduced tumor growth. Next, we mimicked the focal deletions occurring in BRD4 regulatory regions by CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and observed that their depletion functionally ablates tumor cell growth. We finally show that these focal deletions rescue ovarian carcinoma cells from the toxicity effects associated with gene overexpression, suggesting that global BRD4 gene expression levels must be fine tuned to ensure proper cancer cell proliferation. Our study provides experimental evidence for BRD4 deletions constituting the first example of a driver SV alteration reducing toxicity in cancer, therefore expanding the landscape of cancer progression mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Abstract Recently, the cancer community has gained a heightened awareness of the roles of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in cancer proliferation, drug resistance and epigenetic remodeling. However, a hindrance to studying ecDNA is the lack of available cancer model systems that express ecDNA. Increasing our awareness of which model systems express ecDNA will advance our understanding of fundamental ecDNA biology and unlock a wealth of potential targeting strategies for ecDNA-driven cancers. To bridge this gap, we created CytoCellDB, a resource that provides karyotype annotations for cell lines within the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). We identify 139 cell lines that express ecDNA, a 200% increase from what is currently known. We expanded the total number of cancer cell lines with ecDNA annotations to 577, which is a 400% increase, covering 31% of cell lines in CCLE/DepMap. We experimentally validate several cell lines that we predict express ecDNA or homogeneous staining regions (HSRs). We demonstrate that CytoCellDB can be used to characterize aneuploidy alongside other molecular phenotypes, (gene essentialities, drug sensitivities, gene expression). We anticipate that CytoCellDB will advance cytogenomics research as well as provide insights into strategies for developing therapeutics that overcome ecDNA-driven drug resistance.">

        <tr id="Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA), an extrachromosomal circular structured DNA, is extensively found in eukaryotes. Exploring eccDNA at the single-cell level contributes to understanding heterogeneity, evolution, development, and specific functions within cells. Nevertheless, the high-throughput identification methods for single-cell eccDNA are complex, and currently mature and widely applicable technologies are lacking. Those factors have led to a scarcity of resources for studying eccDNA at the single-cell level. Therefore, using available single-cell whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, we have constructed a comprehensive eccDNA database named scEccDNAdb (https://lcbb.swjtu.edu.cn/scEccDNAdb/). Presently, scEccDNAdb comprises 3,195,464 single-cell eccDNA entries from both disease/health human and mouse samples, which provides comprehensive annotations including oncogenes, typical enhancers, super-enhancers, CTCF binding sites, SNPs, chromatin accessibility, eQTLs, transcription factor binding sites, motifs, and SVs. Additionally, it provides nine online analysis and visualization tools, facilitating the generation of publication-quality figures for eccDNA analysis through the upload of customized files. Overall, scEccDNAdb represents the first comprehensive database known to us for exploring and analyzing single-cell eccDNA data in diverse cell types, tissues, and species. Graphical abstract">

        <tr id="Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is a form of a circular double-stranded DNA that exists independently of conventional chromosomes. eccDNA exhibits a broad and random distribution across eukaryotic cells and has been associated with tumor-related properties due to its ability to harbor the complete gene information of oncogenes. The complex and multifaceted mechanisms underlying eccDNA formation include pathways such as DNA damage repair, breakage–fusion–bridge (BFB) mechanisms, chromothripsis, and cell apoptosis. Of note, eccDNA plays a pivotal role in tumor development, genetic heterogeneity, and therapeutic resistance. The high copy number and transcriptional activity of oncogenes carried by eccDNA contribute to the accelerated growth of tumors. Notably, the amplification of oncogenes on eccDNA is implicated in the malignant progression of cancer cells. The improvement of high-throughput sequencing techniques has greatly enhanced our knowledge of eccDNA by allowing for a detailed examination of its genetic structures and functions. However, we still lack a comprehensive and efficient annotation for eccDNA, while challenges persist in the study and understanding of the functional role of eccDNA, emphasizing the need for the development of robust methodologies. The potential clinical applications of eccDNA, such as its role as a measurable biomarker or therapeutic target in diseases, particularly within the spectrum of human malignancies, is a promising field for future research. In conclusion, eccDNA represents a quite dynamic and multifunctional genetic entity with far-reaching implications in cancer pathogenesis and beyond. Further research is essential to unravel the molecular pathways of eccDNA formation, elucidate its functional roles, and explore its clinical applications. Addressing these aspects is crucial for advancing our understanding of genomic instability and developing novel strategies for tailored therapeutics, especially in cancer.">

        <tr id="Oncogene amplification on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a pervasive driver event in cancer, yet our understanding of how ecDNA forms is limited. Here, we couple a CRISPR-based method for ecDNA induction with extensive characterization of newly formed ecDNA to examine their biogenesis. We find that DNA circularization is efficient, irrespective of 3D genome context, with formation of 800kb, 1 Mb, and 1.8 Mb ecDNAs reaching or exceeding 15%. We show non-homologous end joining and microhomology-mediated end joining both contribute to ecDNA formation, while inhibition of DNA-PKcs and ATM have opposing impacts on ecDNA formation. EcDNA and the corresponding chromosomal excision scar can form at significantly different rates and respond differently to DNA-PKcs and ATM inhibition. Taken together, our results support a model of ecDNA formation in which double strand break ends dissociate from their legitimate ligation partners prior to joining of illegitimate ends to form the ecDNA and excision scar.">

        <tr id="Recent advances in high-resolution mapping of spatial interactions among regulatory elements support the existence of complex topological assemblies of enhancers and promoters known as enhancer-promoter hubs or cliques. Yet, organization principles of these multi-interacting enhancer-promoter hubs and their potential role in regulating gene expression in cancer remains unclear. Here, we systematically identified enhancer-promoter hubs in breast cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia. We found that highly interacting enhancer-promoter hubs form at key oncogenes and lineage-associated transcription factors potentially promoting oncogenesis of these diverse cancer types. Genomic and optical mapping of interactions among enhancer and promoter elements further showed that topological alterations in hubs coincide with transcriptional changes underlying acquired resistance to targeted therapy in T cell leukemia and B cell lymphoma. Together, our findings suggest that enhancer-promoter hubs are dynamic and heterogeneous topological assemblies with the potential to control gene expression circuits promoting oncogenesis and drug resistance.">

        <tr id="Whole-genome doubling (WGD) is a critical driver of tumor development and is linked to drug resistance and metastasis in solid malignancies. Here, we demonstrate that WGD is an ongoing mutational process in tumor evolution. Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing, we measured and modeled how WGD events are distributed across cellular populations within tumors and associated WGD dynamics with properties of genome diversification and phenotypic consequences of innate immunity. We studied WGD evolution in 65 high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) tissue samples from 40 patients, yielding 29,481 tumor cell genomes. We found near-ubiquitous evidence of WGD as an ongoing mutational process promoting cell-cell diversity, high rates of chromosomal missegregation, and consequent micronucleation. Using a novel mutation-based WGD timing method, doubleTime, we delineated specific modes by which WGD can drive tumor evolution: (i) unitary evolutionary origin followed by significant diversification, (ii) independent WGD events on a pre-existing background of copy number diversity, and (iii) evolutionarily late clonal expansions of WGD populations. Additionally, through integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that inflammatory signaling and cGAS-STING pathway activation result from ongoing chromosomal instability and are restricted to tumors that remain predominantly diploid. This contrasted with predominantly WGD tumors, which exhibited significant quiescent and immunosuppressive phenotypic states. Together, these findings establish WGD as an evolutionarily ‘active’ mutational process that promotes evolvability and dysregulated immunity in late stage ovarian cancer.">

        <tr id="Although somatic cell genomes are usually entirely clonally inherited, nuclear DNA exchange between cells of an organism can occur sporadically by cell fusion, phagocytosis or other mechanisms1–3. This phenomenon has long been noted in the context of cancer, where it could be envisaged that DNA horizontal transfer plays a functional role in disease evolution4–13. However, an understanding of the frequency and significance of this process in naturally occurring tumours is lacking. The host-tumour genetic discordance of transmissible cancers, malignant clones which pass between animals as allogeneic grafts, provides an opportunity to investigate this. We screened for host-to-tumour horizontal transfer of nuclear DNA in 174 tumours from three transmissible cancers affecting dogs and Tasmanian devils, and detected a single instance in the canine transmissible venereal tumour (CTVT). This involved introduction of a 15-megabase dicentric genetic element, composed of 11 rearranged fragments of six chromosomes, to a CTVT sublineage occurring in Asia around 2,000 years ago. The element forms the short arm of a small submetacentric chromosome, and derives from a dog with ancestry associated with the ancient Middle East. The introduced DNA fragment is transcriptionally active and has adopted the expression profile of CTVT. Its 143 genes do not, however, confer any obvious advantage to its spatially restricted CTVT sublineage. Our findings indicate that nuclear DNA horizontal transfer, although likely a rare event in tumour evolution, provides a viable mechanism for the acquisition of genetic material in naturally occurring cancer genomes.">

We find that cells can harbor >1,000 regulatory elements with haplotype-selective chromatin accessibility (HSCA) and show that these elements preferentially localize to genomic loci containing the most human genetic diversity, with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus showing the largest amount of HSCA genome-wide in immune cells. Furthermore, we uncover HSCA elements with sequence non-deterministic chromatin accessibility, representing likely somatic epimutations, and show that productive transcription from the inactive X chromosome is buttressed by clustered promoter-proximal elements that escape X chromosome inactivation.">

        <tr id="Somatic structural variations (SVs) in cancer can shuffle DNA content in the genome, relocate regulatory elements, and alter genome organization. Enhancer hijacking occurs when SVs relocate distal enhancers to activate proto-oncogenes. However, most enhancer hijacking studies have only focused on protein-coding genes. Here, we develop a computational algorithm 'HYENA' to identify candidate oncogenes (both protein-coding and non-coding) activated by enhancer hijacking based on tumor whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing data. HYENA detects genes whose elevated expression is associated with somatic SVs by using a rank-based regression model. We systematically analyze 1146 tumors across 25 types of adult tumors and identify a total of 108 candidate oncogenes including many non-coding genes. A long non-coding RNA TOB1-AS1 is activated by various types of SVs in 10% of pancreatic cancers through altered 3-dimensional genome structure. We find that high expression of TOB1-AS1 can promote cell invasion and metastasis. Our study highlights the contribution of genetic alterations in non-coding regions to tumorigenesis and tumor progression.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Isodicentric Y chromosomes are relatively common structural variants of the human genome. The underlying mechanism of isodicentric Y chromosomes with short arm breakpoints [idic(Yq)] remains to be clarified.


CASE PRESENTATION
We encountered a Japanese man with azoospermia and mild short stature. G-banding and array-based comparative genomic hybridization indicated that his karyotype was 45,X/46,X,idic(Y)(qter→p11.32::p11.32→qter) with a ~1.8 Mb terminal deletion. Whole genome sequencing suggested that the Y chromosome had four breakpoints in a ~7 kb region of the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1).


CONCLUSION
This case was assumed to have an idic(Yq) resulting from multiple DNA double-strand breaks in PAR1. This rearrangement may have been facilitated by the PAR1-specific chromatin architecture. The clinical features of the patient can be ascribed to SHOX haploinsufficiency and the presence of a 45,X cell line, although copy-number gains of some Yq genes and the size reduction of PAR1 may also contribute to his spermatogenic failure.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BCa) is a major global health challenge, characterized by chromosomal instability (CIN) and subsequent acquisition of extensive somatic copy number alterations (CNAs). CNAs including amplifications and deletions, significantly influence intra-tumor heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Among these, the loss of chromosome 13q14.2 emerges as a considerable factor in BCa pathogenesis and treatment responses. We provide evidence that this genomic alteration is under positive selective pressure, correlating with poorer patient survival. Furthermore, through multi-omic and in vitro analyses, we uncover a dual role of 13q14.2 loss: it confers a survival advantage to tumor cells and modulate the cell cycle and pro-apoptotic pathways in cancer cells, affecting macrophages population in the TME, while paradoxically increasing tumor susceptibility to BCL2 inhibitors. These findings suggest that targeting 13q14.2 as a biomarker in BCa could enhance the efficacy of existing treatments and offer a new avenue for improving clinical outcomes in BCa. Figure 1.

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer is a deadly female cancer with high rates of recurrence. The primary treatment strategy for patients is platinum-based therapy regimens that almost universally develop resistance. Consequently, new therapeutic avenues are needed to overcome the plateau that current therapies have on patient outcomes. We describe a gene amplification involving both HSF1 and MYC, wherein these two genes on chromosome 8q are co-amplified in over 7% of human tumors that is enriched to over 30% of patients with ovarian cancer. We further found that HSF1 and MYC transcriptional activity is correlated in human tumors and ovarian cancer cell lines, suggesting they may cooperate in ovarian cancer cells. CUT&RUN for HSF1 and MYC in co-amplified ovarian cancer cells revealed that HSF1 and MYC have overlapping binding at a substantial number of locations throughout the genome where their binding peaks are near identical. Consistent with these data, a protein-protein interaction between HSF1 and MYC was detected in ovarian cancer cells, implying these two transcription factors have a molecular cooperation. Further supporting their cooperation, growth of HSF1-MYC co-amplified ovarian cancer cells were found to be dependent on both HSF1 and MYC. In an attempt to identify a therapeutic target that could take advantage of this dependency on both HSF1 and MYC, PLK1 was identified as being correlated with HSF1 and MYC in primary human tumor specimens, consistent with a previously established effect of PLK1 on HSF1 and MYC protein levels. Targeting PLK1 with the compound volasertib (BI-6727) revealed a greater than 200-fold increased potency of volasertib in HSF1-MYC co-amplified ovarian cancer cells compared to ovarian cancer cells wild-type HSF1 and MYC copy number, which extended to several growth assays, including spheroid growth. Volasertib, and other PLK1 inhibitors, have not shown great success in clinical trials and this study suggests that targeting PLK1 may be viable in a precision medicine approach using HSF1-MYC co-amplification as a biomarker for response.">

        <tr id="Human tumors progress in part by accumulating epigenetic alterations, which include gains and losses of DNA methylation in different parts of the cancer cell genome. Recent work has revealed a link between these two opposite alterations by showing that DNA hypomethylation in tumors can induce the expression of transcripts that overlap downstream gene promoters and thereby induce their hypermethylation. Preliminary in silico evidence prompted us to investigate if this mechanism applies to the locus harboring AGO1, a gene that plays a central role in miRNA biogenesis and RNA interference. Inspection of public RNA-Seq datasets and RT-qPCR experiments show that an alternative transcript starting 13.4 kb upstream of AGO1 (AGO1-V2) is expressed specifically in testicular germ cells, and becomes aberrantly activated in different types of tumors, particularly in tumors of the esophagus, stomach, and lung. This expression pattern classifies AGO1-V2 into the group of “Cancer-Germline” (CG) genes. Analysis of transcriptomic and methylomic datasets provided evidence that transcriptional activation of AGO1-V2 depends on DNA demethylation of its promoter region. Western blot experiments revealed that AGO1-V2 encodes a shortened isoform of AGO1, corresponding to a truncation of 75 aa in the N-terminal domain, and which we therefore referred to as “∆NAGO1”. Interestingly, significant correlations between hypomethylation/activation of AGO1-V2 and hypermethylation/repression of AGO1 were observed upon examination of tumor cell lines and tissue datasets. Overall, our study reveals the existence of a process of interdependent epigenetic alterations in the AGO1 locus, which promotes swapping between two AGO1 protein-coding mRNA isoforms in tumors.">

        <tr id="Transcriptional enhancers can regulate individual or multiple genes through long-range three-dimensional (3D) genome interactions, and these interactions are commonly altered in cancer. Yet, the functional relationship between changes in 3D interactions associated with regulatory regions and differential gene expression appears context-dependent. In this study, we used HiChiP to capture changes in 3D genome interactions between active regulatory regions of endometrial cancer cells in response to estrogen treatment and uncovered significant differential long-range interactions that are strongly enriched for estrogen receptor α (ER) bound sites (ERBS). The ERBS anchoring differential loops with either a gene’s promoter or distal regions were correlated with larger transcriptional responses to estrogen compared to ERBS not involved in differential interactions. To functionally test this observation, CRISPR-based Enhancer-i was used to deactivate specific ERBS, which revealed a wide range of effects on the transcriptional response to estrogen. However, these effects are only subtly and not significantly stronger for ERBS in differential loops. In addition, we observed an enrichment of 3D interactions between the promoters of estrogen up-regulated genes and found that looped promoters can work together cooperatively. Overall, our work suggests that changes in 3D genome structure upon estrogen treatment identify some functionally important regulatory regions; however, these changes aren’t required for a transcriptional response to E2 in endometrial cancer cells.">

        <tr id="Cancer is a disease underpinned by aberrant gene expression. Enhancers are regulatory elements that play a major role in transcriptional control and changes in active enhancer function are likely critical in the pathogenesis of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). Here, we utilise STARR-seq to profile the genome-wide enhancer landscape in OAC and identify hundreds of high-confidence enhancer elements. These regions are enriched in enhancer-associated chromatin marks, are actively transcribed and exhibit high levels of associated gene activity in OAC cells. These characteristics are maintained in human patient samples, demonstrating their disease relevance. This relevance is further underlined by their responsiveness to oncogenic ERBB2 inhibition and increased activity compared to the pre-cancerous Barrett’s state. Mechanistically, these enhancers are linked to the core OAC transcriptional network and in particular KLF5 binding is associated with high level activity, providing further support for a role of this transcription factor in defining the OAC transcriptome. Our results therefore uncover a set of enhancer elements with physiological significance, that widen our understanding of the molecular alterations in OAC and point to mechanisms through which response to targeted therapy may occur.">

        <tr id="Dysregulation of epigenetic processes leads to a plethora of abnormalities including disease states such as cancer. Therapies focused on epigenetic modulation alter gene expression to correct dysfunction, though the mechanisms and perpetuation of these states is unknown. Here, we use integrated epigenomics and three-dimensional chromatin structure-function analyses after acute histone deacetylase inhibitor cancer drug treatment (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid in lung cancer cells). Treatment induced substantial (13%) genomic rearrangement that rebounds despite persistent gene expression changes and spreading of acetylation. The chromatin functional landscape (accessibility, active transcription modification, and gene expression) is controlled and locus-specific, while chromatin contacts are globally altered resulting in a moderate weakening of topologically associating domains. Chromatin states are more dynamic at transcriptionally active loci while genes with reduced expression are epigenetically stable suggesting chromatin architectural turnover and nucleosome remodeling is locus-specific and underlies the bidirectional expression changes. Thus, local 3D chromatin and genome structural dynamics is integral for loci regulation in response to epigenomic perturbation. The partial persistence of these altered features may have larger implications for efficacy of epigenetic drugs in amelioration of disease states.">

We demonstrate that targeted single-molecule chromatin fiber sequencing (Fiber-seq) achieves this, permitting single-molecule, long-read genomic and epigenomic profiling across targeted >100 kilobase loci with ∼10-fold enrichment over untargeted sequencing. Targeted Fiber-seq reveals that pathogenic expansions of the DMPK CTG repeat that underlie Myotonic Dystrophy 1 are characterized by somatic instability and disruption of multiple nearby regulatory elements, both of which are repeat length-dependent. Furthermore, we reveal that therapeutic adenine base editing of the segmentally duplicated γ-globin (HBG1/HBG2) promoters in primary human hematopoietic cells induced towards an erythroblast lineage increases the accessibility of the HBG1 promoter as well as neighboring regulatory elements. Overall, we find that these non-protein coding mosaic variants can have complex impacts on chromatin architectures, including extending beyond the regulatory element harboring the variant.">

We refined the mutational landscape of pancreatic cancer by capturing events missed by bulk sequencing, and validated the evolution pattern of early fixation of driver single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) followed by generation of intratumoral heterogeneity for copy number variations (CNVs). Intertumoral convergent evolution was common, including subclonal inactivation of TGF-β pathway by mutating various components of it; intratumoral convergence was rarely observed, likely due to strong selective force in pancreatic cancer development. Continuous evolution was frequently seen manifesting as CNVs. In the context of non-targeted treatments, no particular pattern was found across metastases or through treatment. In six pancreatic cancers with germline BRCA2 mutation, we discovered varied timing of biallelic inactivation of BRCA2, which sculpted different evolutionary trajectories and could presumably contribute to differential response to treatment. As the first large-scale application of targeted snDNA-seq on pancreatic cancer, this work provides a sample processing and computational analysis pipeline that warrants further clinical utility.">

        <tr id="We developed a generally applicable method, CRISPR/Cas9-targeted long-read sequencing (CTLR-Seq), to resolve, haplotype-specifically, the large and complex regions in the human genome that had been previously impenetrable to sequencing analysis, such as large segmental duplications (SegDups) and their associated genome rearrangements. CTLR-Seq combines in vitro Cas9-mediated cutting of the genome and pulse-field gel electrophoresis to isolate intact large (i.e., up to 2,000 kb) genomic regions that encompass previously unresolvable genomic sequences. These targets are then sequenced (amplification-free) at high on-target coverage using long-read sequencing, allowing for their complete sequence assembly. We applied CTLR-Seq to the SegDup-mediated rearrangements that constitute the boundaries of, and give rise to, the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS), the most common human microdeletion disorder. We then performed de novo assembly to resolve, at base-pair resolution, the full sequence rearrangements and exact chromosomal breakpoints of 22q11.2DS (including all common subtypes). Across multiple patients, we found a high degree of variability for both the rearranged SegDup sequences and the exact chromosomal breakpoint locations, which coincide with various transposons within the 22q11.2 SegDups, suggesting that 22q11DS can be driven by transposon-mediated genome recombination. Guided by CTLR-Seq results from two 22q11DS patients, we performed three-dimensional chromosomal folding analysis for the 22q11.2 SegDups from patient-derived neurons and astrocytes and found chromosome interactions anchored within the SegDups to be both cell type-specific and patient-specific. Lastly, we demonstrated that CTLR-Seq enables cell-type specific analysis of DNA methylation patterns within the deletion haplotype of 22q11DS.">

        <tr id="Chromosomal translocations in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) result in activation of oncogenes by placing them under the regulation of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) super-enhancers. Aberrant expression of translocated oncogenes induced by enhancer activity can contribute to lymphomagenesis. The role of the IGH enhancers in normal B-cell development is well established, but knowledge regarding the precise mechanisms of their involvement in control of the translocated oncogenes is limited. The goal of this project was to define the critical regions in the IGH regulatory elements and identify enhancer RNAs (eRNA). We designed a sgRNA library densely covering the IGH enhancers and performed tiling CRISPR interference screens in three NHL cell lines. This revealed three regions crucial for NHL cell growth. With chromatin-enriched RNA-Seq we showed transcription from the core enhancer regions and subsequently validated expression of the eRNAs in a panel of NHL cell lines and tissue samples. Inhibition of the essential IGH enhancer regions decreased expression of eRNAs and translocated oncogenes in several NHL cell lines. The observed expression and growth patterns were consistent with the breakpoints in the IGH locus. Moreover, targeting the Eμ enhancer resulted in loss of B-cell receptor expression. In a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, MYC overexpression partially rescued the phenotype induced by IGH enhancer inhibition. Our results indicated the most critical regions in the IGH enhancers and provided new insights into the current understanding of the role of IGH enhancers in B-cell NHL. As such, this study forms a basis for development of potential therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Many essential functions of organisms are encoded in highly repetitive genomic regions, including histones involved in DNA packaging, centromeres that are core components of chromosome segregation, ribosomal RNA comprising the protein translation machinery, telomeres that ensure chromosome integrity, piRNA clusters encoding host defenses against selfish elements, and virtually the entire Y chromosome. These regions, formed by highly similar tandem arrays, pose significant challenges for experimental and informatic study, impeding sequence-level descriptions essential for understanding genetic variation. Here, we report the assembly and variation analysis of such repetitive regions in Drosophila melanogaster, offering significant improvements to the existing community reference assembly. Our work successfully recovers previously elusive segments, including complete reconstructions of the histone locus and the pericentric heterochromatin of the X chromosome, spanning the Stellate locus to the distal flank of the rDNA cluster. To infer structural changes in these regions where alignments are often not practicable, we introduce landmark anchors based on unique variants that are putatively orthologous. These regions display considerable structural variation between different D. melanogaster strains, exhibiting differences in copy number and organization of homologous repeat units between haplotypes. In the histone cluster, although we observe minimal genetic exchange indicative of crossing over, the variation patterns suggest mechanisms such as unequal sister chromatid exchange. We also examine the prevalence and scale of concerted evolution in the histone and Stellate clusters and discuss the mechanisms underlying these observed patterns.">

        <tr id="Abstract Recently, biomolecular condensates formed through liquid–liquid phase separation have been widely reported to regulate key intracellular processes involved in cell biology and pathogenesis. BRD4 is a nuclear protein instrumental to the establishment of phase-separated super-enhancers (SEs) to direct the transcription of important genes. We previously observed that protein droplets of BRD4 became hydrophobic as their size increase, implying an ability of SEs to limit the ionization of water molecules by irradiation. Here, we aim to establish if SEs confer radiation resistance in cancer cells. We established an in vitro DNA damage assay that measures the effect of radicals provoked by the Fenton reaction on DNA integrity. This revealed that DNA damage was markedly reduced when BRD4 underwent phase separation with DNA. Accordingly, co-focal imaging analyses revealed that SE foci and DNA damage foci are mutually exclusive in irradiated cells. Lastly, we observed that the radioresistance of cancer cells was significantly reduced when irradiation was combined with ARV-771, a BRD4 de-stabilizer. Our data revealed the existence of innately radioresistant genomic regions driven by phase separation in cancer cells. The disruption of these phase-separated components enfolding genomic DNA may represent a novel strategy to augment the effects of radiotherapy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Aneuploidy, the presence of an aberrant number of chromosomes, has been associated with tumorigenesis for over a century. More recently, advances in karyotyping techniques have revealed its high prevalence in cancer: About 90% of solid tumors and 50–70% of hematopoietic cancers exhibit chromosome gains or losses. When analyzed at the level of specific chromosomes, there are strong patterns that are observed in cancer karyotypes both pan-cancer and for specific cancer types. These specific aneuploidy patterns correlate strongly with outcomes for tumor initiation, progression, metastasis formation, immune evasion and resistance to therapeutic treatment. Despite their prominence, understanding the basis underlying aneuploidy patterns in cancer has been challenging. Advances in genetic engineering and bioinformatic analyses now offer insights into the genetic determinants of aneuploidy pattern selection. Overall, there is substantial evidence that expression changes of particular genes can act as the positive selective forces for adaptation through aneuploidy. Recent findings suggest that multiple genes contribute to the selection of specific aneuploid chromosomes in cancer; however, further research is necessary to identify the most impactful driver genes. Determining the genetic basis and accompanying vulnerabilities of specific aneuploidy patterns is an essential step in selectively targeting these hallmarks of tumors.">

 We sought to identify mechanisms that activate MYC expression in germinal center B cell-(GCB) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) in the absence of MYC rearrangement. High-throughput CRISPR-interference screens in MYC-rearranged (n=4) and non-MYC-rearranged (n=2) GCB-DLBCL cell lines revealed a distal enhancer complex 436 kb downstream of MYC, GME-1, that was uniquely essential in non-rearranged (MYC-intact) cell lines. CRISPR-interference studies confirmed growth inhibition and MYC downregulation upon GME-1 repression in 4 DLBCL cell lines. ChIP-Seq showed that GME-1 subunits were bound by OCT2, OCA-B, and MEF2B, which are known to activate germinal center-specific enhancers, and knockdown of the corresponding genes reduced MYC expression. GME-1 subunits showed GCB-specific acetylation and accessibility across normal human B cell populations in public chromatin datasets. The mouse ortholog of GME-1 showed germinal center B cell-specific accessibility. GME-1 was strongly acetylated in MYC-intact but not MYC-rearranged GCB-DLBCL cell lines and patient biopsies. Hi-C revealed significant looping of GME-1 to the MYC promoter in MYC protein+, MYC-intact DLBCL biopsies (n=2), but not MYC-rearranged DLBCL (n=2). We used sequence conservation and chromatin accessibility data to define four GME-1 subunits (195A/B and196A/B), which were cloned into luciferase enhancer reporter constructs and compared to two subunits of the BCL6 distal super-enhancer complex that had previously been identified as regulated by the OCT2/OCA-B/MEF2B complex. GME-1 subunit 195B was the only strongly transcription-activating element based on luciferase assays across three MYC-intact cells lines, where it showed activity comparable to BCL6 enhancers. In contrast, GME-1 enhancers were minimally active in reporter assays performed in two MYC-rearranged GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Deletion of a conserved OCT2 binding site or knockdown of the POU2F2 and POU2AF1 genes reduced activity of GME-1. Thus GME-1 trans-regulation is divergent from that of previously characterized GCB enhancers, despite shared dependency on the OCT2 ternary complex. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed that the GME-1 dependent cell line SUDHL5 bears a 176bp tandem duplication within GME-1 195B. This altered enhancer showed stronger luciferase reporter activity across three MYC-intact cell lines. Published WGS datasets showed isolated genomic tandem copy gains of GME-1 in 2/49 biopsies from recurrent/refractory DLBCL and 1/93 unselected DLBCL. In a cohort of 18 DLBCL with the high-risk DZSig gene expression signature, GME-1 amplification was seen in two biopsies with concurrent deletion of the PVT1 promoter (PVT1-P) and no inter-chromosomal MYC locus rearrangement. CRISPRi showed that PVT1-P repression reduced growth and MYC expression in GME-1-dependent DLBCL, but not in cell lines where rearrangements removed PVT-P from its position in cis with the MYC gene. Our findings identify GME-1 as an activator of MYC expression and target of rare but recurrent genomic copy gains in high-risk DLBCL.

        <tr id="Recurrent mutations in serine / arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2), particularly the proline-to-histidine substitution at position 95 (P95H), have been proposed to drive neoplastic diseases. SRSF2 plays pivotal roles in pre-mRNA processing and gene transcription. However, the precise impact of these diverse functions of SRSF2 on cancer cell behaviour remains unclear. Here, we show that deletion or homozygous P95H mutation of SRSF2 both cause extensive DNA damage leading to cell cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo, regardless of cell genotype. We mechanistically demonstrate that SRSF2 is required for efficient bi-directional transcription of DNA replication and repair genes, independent of its function in splicing. In contrast, SRSF2 haploinsufficiency induces DNA damage without halting the cell cycle in cancer cells. Inducing the heterozygous Srsf2 P95H mutation leads to clonal expansion of epidermal cells in mouse skin, but tumor formation is inhibited following exposure to carcinogens. To survive carcinogen treatment, cells containing the Srsf2 P95H mutation undergo substantial transcription rewiring that restores bi-directional gene expression. Thus, our study reveals crucial roles of SRSF2 beyond splicing and underscores its importance in regulating transcription to orchestrate the cell cycle along with the DNA damage response.">

To understand the functional genomic roles of DNA modifications, it is critical to accurately map their diverse chemical forms with single-nucleotide precision in complex genomes, but it remains challenging. Click-code-seq is a click-chemistry-aided single-nucleotide-resolution strategy for guanine-oxidation mapping, used in yeast DNA but having poor applicability to human genomes. Here, we upgraded click-code-seq to enable its first application for sequencing DNA oxidation and depurination in human genomes. For this, we developed a companion fluorescence assay, click-fluoro-quant, to rapidly quantify different common DNA modifications, and devised novel adapters to minimize false modification detection and assess modification frequency in cell populations. We uncovered that endogenous DNA oxidation in a human cell line has a highly similar pattern to cancer mutational signatures associated with reactive oxygen species. We established that the DNA-alkylating chemotherapy drug irofulven preferentially induces depurination in ApA dimers and promoter regions. Intriguingly, we revealed that oxidized guanines and apurinic sites, both irofulven-induced and endogenous, are depleted in gene transcribed strands, and the strand bias widens with increasing gene expression. This work substantially advances click-code-seq for deciphering the impacts of key modifications in human DNA on cellular physiology and toxicological responses.">

        <tr id="Intra-tumor heterogeneity is an important driver of tumor evolution and therapy response. Advances in precision cancer treatment will require understanding of mutation clonality and subclonal architecture. Currently the slow computational speed of subclonal reconstruction hinders large cohort studies. To overcome this bottleneck, we developed Clonal structure identification through Pairwise Penalization, or CliPP, which clusters subclonal mutations using a regularized likelihood model. CliPP reliably processed whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data from over 12,000 tumor samples within 24 hours, thus enabling large-scale downstream association analyses between subclonal structures and clinical outcomes. Through a pan-cancer investigation of 7,827 tumors from 32 cancer types, we found that high subclonal mutational load (sML), a measure of latency time in tumor evolution, was significantly associated with better patient outcomes in 16 cancer types with low to moderate tumor mutation burden (TMB). In a cohort of prostate cancer patients participating in an immunotherapy clinical trial, high sML was indicative of favorable response to immune checkpoint blockade. This comprehensive study using CliPP underscores sML as a key feature of cancer. sML may be essential for linking mutation dynamics with immunotherapy response in the large population of non-high TMB cancers.">

        <tr id="Copy number alterations (CNAs), resulting from the gain or loss of genetic material from as little as 50 base pairs or as big as entire chromosome(s), have been associated with many congenital diseases, de novo syndromes and cancer. It is established that CNAs disturb the dosage of genomic regions including enhancers/promoters, long non-coding RNA and gene(s) among others, ultimately leading to an altered balance of key cellular functions. In cancer, CNAs have been associated with almost all steps of the disease: predisposition, initiation, development, maintenance, response to treatment, resistance, and relapse. Therefore, understanding how specific CNAs contribute to tumourigenesis may provide prognostic insight and ultimately lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes. In this review, we provide a snapshot of what is currently known about CNAs and cancer, incorporating topics regarding their detection, clinical impact, origin, and nature, and discuss the integration of innovative genetic engineering strategies, to highlight the potential for targeting CNAs using novel, dosage-sensitive and less toxic therapies for CNA-driven cancer.">

This REPAIRome resource is validated through the identification of novel mechanisms, pathways and factors involved in DSB repair, including unexpected opposing roles for XLF and PAXX in DNA end processing, a molecular explanation for Cas9-induced multi-nucleotide insertions, the identification of HLTF as a DSB-repair factor, the involvement of the SAGA complex in microhomology-mediated end joining, and importantly, an indel mutational signature linked to VHL loss, renal carcinoma and hypoxia.

        <tr id="Cancer chimeric, or fusion, transcripts are thought to most frequently appear due to chromosomal aberrations that combine moieties of unrelated normal genes. When being expressed, this results in chimeric RNAs having upstream and downstream parts relatively to the breakpoint position for the 5’- and 3’-fusion components, respectively. As many other types of cancer mutations, fusion genes can be of either driver or passenger type. The driver fusions may have pivotal roles in malignisation by regulating survival, growth, and proliferation of tumor cells, whereas the passenger fusions most likely have no specific function in cancer. The majority of research on fusion gene formation events is concentrated on identifying fusion proteins through chimeric transcripts. However, contemporary studies evidence that fusion events involving non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes may also have strong oncogenic potential. In this review we highlight most frequent classes of ncRNAs fusions and summarize current understanding of their functional roles. In many cases, cancer ncRNA fusion can result in altered concentration of the non-coding RNA itself, or it can promote protein expression from the protein-coding fusion moiety. Differential splicing, in turn, can enrich the repertoire of cancer chimeric transcripts, e.g. as observed for the fusions of circular RNAs and long non-coding RNAs. These and other ncRNA fusions are being increasingly recognized as cancer biomarkers and even potential therapeutic targets. Finally, we discuss the use of ncRNA fusion genes in the context of cancer detection and therapy.">

        <tr id="Purpose: Complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCRs) are rare structural variants involving three or more chromosomal break- points. Most de novo reported CCRs pose challenges for diagnosis and management. They often require karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) for clinical diagnosis because of the limitations of each method. Here we report an inherited exceptionally complex CCR involving 4 chromosomes and 11 breakpoints in a family with multisystem anomalies. Methods: We evaluated the CCRs using karyotyping, FISH, CMA, and two emerging genomic technologies: high-throughput chromosome conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C; aka genomic proximity mapping, GPM) and optical genome mapping (OGM). We also performed functional studies using transcriptome and methylome analyses. Results: The proband, who had intellectual disability and immune deficiency, shared CCRs with her unaffected mother involving chromosomes 1, 7, and 11 by karyotyping. However, CMA revealed a duplication and three deletions in the proband in contrast to her mother's balanced genome. Hi-C (GPM) and OGM detected the CCRs and copy number alterations but also uncovered additional breakpoints at high resolution, including an insertion in 4p and two cryptic rearrangements at 7p. Transcriptome and methylome analyses identified likely biological pathways associated with the proband's phenotypes. Conclusion: Combining cytogenetic and genomic methods provided comprehensive characterization and defined the breakpoints at high resolution in both proband and mother. This underscores the value of novel cytogenetic and genomic techniques in deciphering complex genome rearrangements and the significance of integrative genomic analysis and functional characterization in understanding clinical phenotypes.">

Single gene mutations alone do not fully explain cancer onset and progression; instead, clustered mutations—simultaneous occurrences of multiple mutations—are considered to be pivotal in cancer development and advancement. These mutations can affect different genes and pathways, resulting in cells undergoing malignant transformation with multiple functional abnormalities. Clustered mutations influence cancer growth rates, metastatic potential, and drug treatment sensitivity. This summary highlights the various types and characteristics of clustered mutations to understand their associations with carcinogenesis and discusses their potential clinical significance in cancer. As a unique mutation type, clustered mutations may involve genomic instability, DNA repair mechanism defects, and environmental exposures, potentially correlating with responsiveness to immunotherapy. Understanding the characteristics and underlying processes of clustered mutations enhances our comprehension of carcinogenesis and cancer progression, providing new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for cancer.">

        <tr id="Male sex chromosome aneuploidies are frequent genetic aberrations in humans characterized by additional Y or X chromosome complements. Jacob (JS) and Klinefelter syndromes (KS), carrying 47,XYY and 47,XXY chromosomes, respectively, share several clinical features, including sterility, hormonal deficits, neurocognitive delay, and skeletal-muscle defects. Despite the high incidence, a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations in sex aneuploid patients is still elusive. In this study, we generated and characterized the inaugural cohort of 47,XYY human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We performed a comprehensive transcriptional analysis, including JS primary fibroblasts, iPSCs, and neural stem cells (NSCs) alongside KS cells. Our study revealed a transcriptional feedback mechanism tuning non-PAR X chromosome genes (NPX) homologs in Y supernumerary cells, a phenomenon not detected in X aneuploid iPSCs. By ectopically modulating the expression of selected NPY genes, we demonstrated a direct transcriptional link between the UTY-UTX gene pair. Furthermore, our analyses identified a shared transcriptomic signature between JS and KS, discernible already at the iPSC stage, with a notable enrichment for processes related to neurological functions. This transcriptomic convergence underscores potential commonalities in the molecular pathways underpinning the pathophysiology of male sex chromosome aneuploidies. Finally, through genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of JS iPSCs, we demonstrated that a supernumerary Y chromosome only minimally impacts the methylation status of 47,XYY cells at the pluripotent stage. Our work reveals critical transcriptional feedback mechanisms and shared gene expression signatures in male sex chromosome aneuploidies, paving the way for a better understanding of their common phenotypic features.">

        <tr id="An obligate step in the life cycle of HIV-1 and other retroviruses is the establishment of the provirus in target cell chromosomes. Transcriptional regulation of proviruses is complex, and understanding the mechanisms underlying this regulation has ramifications for fundamental biology, human health, and gene therapy implementation. The three core components of the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex, TASOR, MPHOSPH8 (MPP8), and PPHLN1 (Periphilin 1), were identified in forward genetic screens for host genes that repress provirus expression. Subsequent loss-of-function screens revealed accessory proteins that collaborate with the HUSH complex to silence proviruses in particular contexts. To identify proteins associated with a HUSH complex-repressed provirus in human cells, we developed a technique, Provirus Proximal Proteomics, based on proximity labeling with C-BERST (dCas9-APEX2 biotinylation at genomic elements by restricted spatial tagging). Our screen exploited a lentiviral reporter that is silenced by the HUSH complex in a manner that is independent of the integration site in chromatin. Our data reveal that proviruses silenced by the HUSH complex are associated with DNA repair, mRNA processing, and transcriptional silencing proteins, including L3MBTL2, a member of the non-canonical polycomb repressive complex 1.6 (PRC1.6). A forward genetic screen confirmed that PRC1.6 components L3MBTL2 and MGA contribute to HUSH complex-mediated silencing. PRC1.6 was then shown to silence HUSH-sensitive proviruses in a promoter-specific manner. Genome wide profiling showed striking colocalization of the PRC1.6 and HUSH complexes on chromatin, primarily at sites of active promoters. Finally, PRC1.6 binding at a subset of genes that are silenced by the HUSH complex was dependent on the core HUSH complex component MPP8. These studies offer new tools with great potential for studying the transcriptional regulation of proviruses and reveal crosstalk between the HUSH complex and PRC1.6.">

        <tr id="While genome-wide association studies and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis have made significant progress in identifying noncoding variants associated with prostate cancer risk and bulk tissue transcriptome changes, the regulatory effect of these genetic elements on gene expression remains largely unknown. Recent developments in single-cell sequencing have made it possible to perform ATAC-seq and RNA-seq profiling simultaneously to capture functional associations between chromatin accessibility and gene expression. In this study, we tested our hypothesis that this multiome single-cell approach allows for mapping regulatory elements and their target genes at prostate cancer risk loci. We applied a 10X Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression platform to encapsulate Tn5 transposase-tagged nuclei from multiple prostate cell lines for a total of 65,501 high quality single cells from RWPE1, RWPE2, PrEC, BPH1, DU145, PC3, 22Rv1 and LNCaP cell lines. To address data sparsity commonly seen in the single-cell sequencing, we performed targeted sequencing to enrich sequencing data at prostate cancer risk loci involving 2,730 candidate germline variants and 273 associated genes. Although not increasing the number of captured cells, the targeted multiome data did improve eQTL gene expression abundance by about 20% and chromatin accessibility abundance by about 5%. Based on this multiomic profiling, we further associated RNA expression alterations with chromatin accessibility of germline variants at single cell levels. Cross validation analysis showed high overlaps between the multiome associations and the bulk eQTL findings from GTEx prostate cohort. We found that about 20% of GTEx eQTLs were covered within the significant multiome associations (p-value ≤ 0.05, gene abundance percentage ≥ 5%), and roughly 10% of the multiome associations could be identified by significant GTEx eQTLs. We also analyzed accessible regions with available heterozygous SNP reads and observed more frequent association in genomic regions with allelically accessible variants (p = 0.0055). Among these findings were previously reported regulatory variants including rs60464856-RUVBL1 (multiome p-value = 0.0099 in BPH1) and rs7247241-SPINT2 (multiome p-value = 0.0002- 0.0004 in 22Rv1). We also functionally validated a new regulatory SNP and its target gene rs2474694-VPS53 (multiome p-value = 0.00956 in BPH1 and 0.00625 in DU145) by reporter assay and SILAC proteomics sequencing.

We show that cells exposed to a low dose of therapy adapt to become resistant to a high dose, demonstrating that resistance was not purely selective. The application of therapy itself results in the encoding of transient gene expression into cellular memory and that this encoding occurs for both transiently induced and probabilistically arising expression. Chromatin accessibility showed concomitant persistence. A two-color AP-1 reporter system showed that these memories are encoded in cis, constituting an example of activating cis epigenetics. Our findings establish the formation and maintenance of cellular memories as a critical aspect of gene regulation during the development of therapy resistance.">

        <tr id="The relevant role of LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition in cancer has been recurrently demonstrated in recent years. However, their repetitive nature hampers their identification and detection, hence remaining inaccessible for clinical practice. Also, its clinical relevance for cancer patients is still limited. Here, we develop a new method to quantify L1 activation, called RetroTest, based on targeted sequencing and a sophisticated bioinformatic pipeline, allowing its application in tumor biopsies. First, we performed the benchmarking of the method and confirmed its high specificity and reliability. Then, we unravel the L1 activation in HNSCC according to a more extensive cohort including all the HNSCC tumor stages. Our results confirm that RetroTest is remarkably efficient for L1 detection in tumor biopsies, reaching a high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, L1 retrotransposition estimation reveals a surprisingly early activation in HNSCC progression, contrary to its classical association with advanced tumor stages. This early activation together with the genomic mutational profiling of normal adjacent tissues supports field cancerization process in this tumor.

        <tr id="DNA, is assaulted by endogenous and exogenous agents that lead to the formation of damage. In order to maintain genome integrity DNA repair pathways must be efficiently activated to prevent mutations and deleterious chromosomal rearrangements. Conversely, genome flexibility is also necessary to allow genetic diversity and evolution. The antagonist interaction between maintenance of genome integrity and flexibility determines genome shape and organization. Therefore, it is of great interest to understand how the whole linear genome structure behaves upon formation and repair of DNA damage. For this, we used long reads sequencing technology to identify and to characterize genomic structural variations (SV) of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana somatic cells exposed either to UV-B, to UV-C or to protons irradiations. We found that genomic regions located in heterochromatin a more prone to form SVs than those located in euchromatin, highlighting that genome stability and flexibility differs along the chromosome. This holds true in Arabidopsis plants deficient for the expression of master regulators of the DNA Damage Response (DDR), ATM and ATR, suggesting that independent and alternative surveillance processes exist to maintain integrity in genic regions. Finally, the analysis of the radiations-induced deleted regions allowed determining that exposure UV-B, UV-C and protons induced the Microhomology-mediated end joining mechanism (MMEJ) and that both ATM and ATR repress this repair pathway.">

        <tr id="Introduction. It has been established that the presence of homologous recombination deficiency in a breast tumor is associated with the effectiveness of treatment. But despite the high chemosensitivity of the tumor to DNA-damaging agents, complete pathological responses to treatment are very rare. And this process may be based on a change in the somatic status of BRCA1, that is, a reversion and return of the wild-type allele occurs and the DNA repair function is restored.Aim. To evaluate changes in the presence of chromosomal aberrations and the expression profile of the main genes of homologous recombination in cell models of breast cancer under the influence of cisplatin and docetaxel.Materials and methods. The study was conducted on breast cancer tumor cell cultures: MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. A cell model of drug resistance was obtained for two drugs: cisplatin and docetaxel. RNA and DNA were isolated from cell suspension using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit and QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany), respectively. The expression level of homologous recombination genes was assessed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. To assess the presence of chromosomal aberrations, microarray analysis was performed on DNA chips.Results. Restoration of normal copy number for the BRCA1, CDK12, CHEK1 and RAD51D genes in MCF-7 under the influence of cisplatin was shown. For BRCA2 and PALB2, amplifications were detected. A statistically significant increase in the expression of the BRCA1 (p = 0.04), BRCA2 (p = 0.02), PALB2 (p = 0.01) and RAD51D (p = 0.05) genes was also shown. MDAMB-231 shows that all identified loci with deletions, where the BRCA2, BARD1, CHEK2, PALB2 and RAD54L genes are localized, are restored to normal copy number by cisplatin. The appearance of amplifications was registered for BRCA1, BRIP1, FANCL, RAD51B, PARP1. A similar result was shown for docetaxel. An increase in the expression level is typical for the genes BRCA1 (p = 0.02), BRCA2 (p = 0.02), CHEK2 (p = 0.05), FANCL (p = 0.04), PALB2 (p = 0.05), RAD51C (p = 0.02), PARP1 (p = 0.02), which corresponds to the appearance of amplifications. In the MDA-MB-468 cell culture, an increase in the copy number of only the BRCA1 gene is observed. The effect of docetaxel has no effect on this cell culture. The level of BRCA1 expression increases in direct proportion to the duration of drug action.Conclusion. Thus, the study showed that under the influence of cisplatin, reversion of not only homologous recombination gene mutations, but also other disorders can occur.">

        <tr id="Animal chromosomes can persist with recognizable homology over hundreds of millions of years, in spite of homology-obfuscating processes such as chromosomal fusion and translocation. The frequency and pace of these major genome structural changes are unknown, and it remains unclear whether or how they impact long-term genome evolution. Here, we compare whole chromosomal sequences of 3,631 genomes from 2,291 species spanning all major animal clades and show that animal karyotypes evolve primarily via karyotype contraction, associated with increased rates of chromosomal fusion-with-mixing and dispersion that largely obey chromosomal algebra1, or karyotype expansion, which breaks up ancestral linkage groups and forms new chromosomal elements via non-algebraic changes. We show that chromosomal changes can be associated with major extinction events. Using a multi-scale encoding of pan-animal genome homology and a manifold representation of genomic changes, we find that genome evolution is not only driven by changes at the chromosomal level, but that subchromosomal mixing and irreversibility define clade-specific evolution. Using this ‘evolutionary genome topology’ approach, we calculate extrema of irreversible genomic configurations and identify species that occupy intermediate manifold positions, providing evidence for distinct macro-evolutionary trajectories. We propose that investigation of mixed state accumulation around important gene loci (such as Hox) will be crucial in capturing and further study of clade-specific regulatory innovations.">

Here we trained large language model DNABERT on existing data generated by KEx, a rapid chemical footprinting technique performed on live, intact cells using potassium permanganate. The snapshot of flipon state when combined with results from other in vitro methods that are performed on permeabilized cells, allows a high confidence mapping of G-flipons to proximal enhancer and promoter sequences.

        <tr id="The most significant genetic influence on eye color pigmentation is attributed to the intronic SNP rs12913832 in the HERC2 gene, which interacts with the promoter region of the contiguous OCA2 gene. This interaction, through the formation of a chromatin loop, modulates the transcriptional activity of OCA2, directly affecting eye color pigmentation. Recent advancements in technology have elucidated the precise spatial organization of the genome within the cell nucleus, with chromatin architecture playing a pivotal role in regulating various genome functions. In this study, we investigated the organization of the chromatin close to the HERC2/OCA2 locus in human lymphocyte nuclei using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. The 3 Mb of genomic DNA that belonged to the chromosomal region 15q12-q13.1 revealed the presence of three contiguous chromatin loops, which exhibited a different level of compaction depending on the presence of the A or G allele in the SNP rs12913832. Moreover, the analysis of the genomic organization of the genes has demonstrated that this chromosomal region is evolutionarily highly conserved, as evidenced by the analysis of syntenic regions in species from other Vertebrate classes. Thus, the role of rs12913832 variant is relevant not only in determining the transcriptional activation of the OCA2 gene but also in the chromatin compaction of a larger region, underscoring the critical role of chromatin organization in the proper regulation of the involved genes. It is crucial to consider the broader implications of this finding, especially regarding the potential regulatory role of similar polymorphisms located within intronic regions, which do not influence the same gene by modulating the splicing process, but they regulate the expression of adjacent genes. Therefore, caution should be exercised when utilizing whole-exome sequencing for diagnostic purposes, as intron sequences may provide valuable gene regulation information on the region where they reside. Thus, future research efforts should also be directed towards gaining a deeper understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying the role and mode of action of intronic SNPs in chromatin loop organization and transcriptional regulation.">

        <tr id="Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a significant health burden due to tumor heterogeneity and treatment resistance, emphasizing the need for improved biological understanding and tailored therapies. This study enrolled 31 HNSCC patients for the establishment of patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs), which faithfully maintained genomic features and histopathological traits of primary tumors. Long-term culture preserved key characteristics, affirming PDOs as robust representative models. PDOs demonstrated predictive capability for cisplatin treatment responses, correlating ex vivo drug sensitivity with patient outcomes. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing unveiled molecular subtypes and intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) in PDOs, paralleling patient tumors. Notably, a hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal transition (hEMT)-like ITH program is associated with cisplatin resistance and poor patient survival. Functional analyses identified amphiregulin (AREG) as a potential regulator of the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal state. Moreover, AREG contributes to cisplatin resistance via EGFR pathway activation, corroborated by clinical samples. In summary, HNSCC PDOs serve as reliable and versatile models, offer predictive insights into ITH programs and treatment responses, and uncover potential therapeutic targets for personalized medicine. One Sentence Summary This study establishes patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) from 31 Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, faithfully recapitulating characteristics of primary tumors and accurately predicting clinical responses to cisplatin treatment.

This study builds on our previous work demonstrating that the RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) transcription inhibitor CX-5461 elicits a non-canonical DNA damage response and our discovery of a critical role for Topoisomerase 2α (Top2α) in the initiation of Pol I-dependent transcription. Here, we identify Top2α as a mediator of CX-5461 response in the murine Eµ-Myc B lymphoma model whereby sensitivity to CX-5461 is dependent on cellular Top2α expression/activity. Most strikingly, and in contrast to canonical Top2α poisons, we found that the Top2α-dependent DNA damage induced by CX-5461 is preferentially localized at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) promoter region, thereby highlighting CX-5461 as a loci-specific DNA damaging agent. This mechanism underpins the efficacy of CX-5461 against certain types of cancer and can be used to develop effective non-genotoxic anticancer drugs.">

Defects in these processes have been associated with various diseases, including cancer. While cancer-focused sequencing studies have identified numerous driver mutations in protein-coding sequences, noncoding drivers – particularly those affecting the cis-elements required for pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation – have received less attention. Here, we systematically analysed cancer somatic mutations affecting 3’UTR polyadenylation signals using the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) dataset. We found a striking enrichment of cancer-specific somatic mutations that disrupt strong and evolutionarily conserved cleavage and polyadenylation signals within tumour suppressor genes. Further bioinformatics and experimental analyses conducted as a part of our study suggest that these mutations have a profound capacity to downregulate the expression of tumour suppressor genes.

        <tr id="Interphase mammalian genomes are folded in 3D with complex locus-specific patterns that impact gene regulation. CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is a key architectural protein that binds specific DNA sites, halts cohesin-mediated loop extrusion, and enables long-range chromatin interactions. There are hundreds of thousands of annotated CTCF-binding sites in mammalian genomes; disruptions of some result in distinct phenotypes, while others have no visible effect. Despite their importance, the determinants of which CTCF sites are necessary for genome folding and gene regulation remain unclear. Here, we update and utilize Akita, a convolutional neural network model, to extract the sequence preferences and grammar of CTCF contributing to genome folding. Our analyses of individual CTCF sites reveal four predictions: (i) only a small fraction of genomic sites are impactful, (ii) insulation strength is highly dependent on sequences flanking the core CTCF binding motif, (iii) core and flanking sequences are broadly compatible, and (iv) core and flanking nucleotides contribute largely additively to overall strength. Our analysis of collections of CTCF sites make two predictions for multi-motif grammar: (i) insulation strength depends on the number of CTCF sites within a cluster, and (ii) pattern formation is governed by the orientation and spacing of these sites, rather than any inherent specialization of the CTCF motifs themselves. In sum, we present a framework for using neural network models to probe the sequences instructing genome folding and provide a number of predictions to guide future experimental inquiries. Author Summary Mammalian genomes are spatially organized in 3D with profound consequences for all processes involving DNA. CTCF is a key genome organizer, recognizing numerous sites and creating a variety of contact patterns across the genome. Despite the importance of CTCF, the sequence determinants and grammar of how individual sites collectively instruct genome folding remain unclear. This work leverages the ability of Akita, a deep neural network, to make high-throughput predictions for genome folding after DNA sequence perturbations. Using Akita, we make several experimentally testable predictions. First, only a minority of annotated sites individually impact folding, and flanking DNA sequences greatly modulate their impact. Second, multiple sites together influence folding based on their number, orientation, and spacing. In sum, we provide a roadmap for interpreting neural networks to better understand genome folding and important considerations for the design of experiments.">

Compared with MMRd-del genomes, MMRd-ins genomes exhibit distinct mutational and transcriptomic features, including a higher prevalence of T>C substitutions and related mutation signatures. Short insertions and deletions in MMRd-ins and MMRd-del genomes target different sets of genes, resulting in distinct indel profiles between the two subtypes. In addition, indels in the MMRd-ins genomes are enriched with subclonal alterations that provide clues about a distinct evolutionary relationship between the MMRd-ins and MMRd-del genomes. Notably, the transcriptome analysis indicated that MMRd-ins cancers upregulate immune-related genes, show a high level of immune cell infiltration, and display an elevated neoantigen burden. The genomic and transcriptomic distinctions between the two types of MMRd genomes highlight the heterogeneity of genetic mechanisms and resulting genomic footprints and transcriptomic changes in cancers, which has potential clinical implications.">

        <tr id="Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic condition characterized by features of accelerated aging, and individuals with HGPS seldom live beyond their mid-teens. The syndrome is commonly caused by a point mutation in the LMNA gene which codes for lamin A and its splice variant lamin C, components of the nuclear lamina. The mutation causing HGPS leads to production of a truncated, farnesylated form of lamin A referred to as “progerin.” Progerin is also expressed at low levels in healthy individuals and appears to play a role in normal aging. HGPS is associated with an accumulation of genomic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and alterations in the nature of DSB repair. The source of DSBs in HGPS is often attributed to stalling and subsequent collapse of replication forks in conjunction with faulty recruitment of repair factors to damage sites. In this work, we used a model system involving immortalized human cell lines to investigate progerin-induced genomic damage. Using an immunofluorescence approach to visualize phosphorylated histone H2AX foci which mark sites of genomic damage, we report that cells engineered to express progerin displayed a significant elevation of endogenous damage in the absence of any change in the cell cycle profile or doubling time of cells. Genomic damage was enhanced and persistent in progerin-expressing cells treated with hydroxyurea. Overexpression of wild-type lamin A did not elicit the outcomes associated with progerin expression. Our results show that DNA damage caused by progerin can occur independently from global changes in replication or cell proliferation.">

        <tr id="Background: Intermediate cell carcinoma (Int-CA) is a rare and enigmatic primary liver cancer characterized by uniform tumor cells exhibiting mixed features of both HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Despite the unique pathological features of int-CA, its molecular characteristics remain unclear yet. Methods: RNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing profiling were performed on int-CA tumors and compared with those of HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Results: Int-CAs unveiled a distinct and intermediate transcriptomic feature that is strikingly different from both HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The marked abundance of splicing events leading to intron retention emerged as a signature feature of int-CA, along with a prominent expression of Notch signaling. Further exploration revealed that METTL16 was suppressed within int-CA, showing a DNA copy number–dependent transcriptional deregulation. Notably, experimental investigations confirmed that METTL16 suppression facilitated invasive tumor characteristics through the activation of the Notch signaling cascade. Conclusions: Our results provide a molecular landscape of int-CA featured by METTL16 suppression and frequent intron retention events, which may play pivotal roles in the acquisition of the aggressive phenotype of Int-CA.">

        <tr id="Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is a unique DNA polymerase capable of template-independent extension of DNA with random nucleotides. TdT’s de novo DNA synthesis ability has found utility in DNA recording, DNA data storage, oligonucleotide synthesis, and nucleic acid labeling, but TdT’s intrinsic nucleotide biases limit its versatility in such applications. Here, we describe a multiplexed assay for profiling and engineering the bias and overall activity of TdT variants in high throughput. In our assay, a library of TdTs is encoded next to a CRISPR-Cas9 target site in HEK293T cells. Upon transfection of Cas9 and sgRNA, the target site is cut, allowing TdT to intercept the double strand break and add nucleotides. Each resulting insertion is sequenced alongside the identity of the TdT variant that generated it. Using this assay, 25,623 unique TdT variants, constructed by site-saturation mutagenesis at strategic positions, were profiled. This resulted in the isolation of several altered-bias TdTs that expanded the capabilities of our TdT-based DNA recording system, Cell History Recording by Ordered Insertion (CHYRON), by increasing the information density of recording through an unbiased TdT and achieving dual-channel recording of two distinct inducers (hypoxia and Wnt) through two differently biased TdTs. Select TdT variants were also tested in vitro, revealing concordance between each variant’s in vitro bias and the in vivo bias determined from the multiplexed high throughput assay. Overall, our work, and the multiplex assay it features, should support the continued development of TdT-based DNA recorders, in vitro applications of TdT, and further study of the biology of TdT.">

        <tr id="Abstract DNA Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are harmful lesions and major sources of genomic instability. Studies have suggested that DSBs induce local transcriptional silencing that consequently promotes genomic stability. Several factors have been proposed to actively participate in this process, including ATM and Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Here we found that disrupting PRC1 clustering disrupts DSB-induced gene silencing. Interactome analysis of PHC2, a PRC1 subunit that promotes the formation of the Polycomb body, found several nucleoporins that constitute the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC). Similar to PHC2, depleting the nucleoporins also disrupted the DSB-induced gene silencing. We found that some of these nucleoporins, such as NUP107 and NUP43, which are members of the Y-complex of NPC, localize to DSB sites. These nucleoporin-enriched DSBs were distant from the nuclear periphery. The presence of nucleoporins and PHC2 at DSB regions were inter-dependent, suggesting that they act cooperatively in the DSB-induced gene silencing. We further found two structural components within NUP107 to be necessary for the transcriptional repression at DSBs: ATM/ATR-mediated phosphorylation at Serine37 residue within the N-terminal disordered tail, and the NUP133-binding surface at the C-terminus. These results provide a new functional interplay among nucleoporins, ATM and the Polycomb proteins in the DSB metabolism, and underscore their emerging roles in genome stability maintenance. *Hongseon Song, Yubin Bae, Sangin Kim, and Dante Deascanis contributed equally to this work.">

        <tr id="Background and Aim: Canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT), a unique transmissible cancer in dogs, affects the external genitalia and potentially spreads to other parts of the body. While somatic mutations in oncogenic and tumor-suppressing genes are linked to CTVT development, the impact of DNA methylation, which affects gene expression, remains unclear. This study explored whether DNA methylation in the promoter regions of the MYC oncogene and CDKN2B tumor suppressor genes in CTVTs is associated with their expression, both at the gene and protein levels. 

Materials and Methods: To investigate promoter DNA methylation of MYC and CDKN2B in CTVTs, we analyzed frozen tissue samples from genital CTVT (GTVTs) and extragenital CTVT (ETVTs). Genomic DNA was extracted, bisulfite-treated, and analyzed using bisulfite polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The messenger RNA and protein of MYC and CDKN2B were also extracted and assessed by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Matching formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks were used for immunohistochemical staining to visualize protein distribution in GTVT and ETVT tissues. 

Results: Although both GTVT and ETVT samples showed MYC promoter methylation, the extent of methylation differed significantly. GTVTs displayed a much higher degree of methylation, potentially explaining the more pronounced downregulation of MYC gene expression and reduction in c-MYC protein levels observed in GTVTs compared with ETVTs. Our data revealed a prevalent hypermethylation pattern in the CDKN2B promoter across both sample types. However, DNA methylation, which was expected to have a suppressive effect, did not correlate with gene/protein expression. GTVTs displayed high protein levels despite significantly reduced CDKN2B expression. Conversely, ETVTs maintained regular CDKN2B expression but exhibited reduced protein production, suggesting a complex interplay between methylation and expression in these tumors. 

Conclusion: MYC demonstrated a clear association between its promoter methylation status, gene expression, and protein levels; however, CDKN2B lacked this correlation, implying the involvement of methylation-independent regulatory mechanisms and highlighting the need for further investigation.

Here, we systematically catalog this variation by assaying mtCN in 52 human tissues across 952 donors (10,499 samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project) and 20 murine tissues using qPCR, capturing 50- and 200-fold variation, respectively. We also estimate per cell mtCN across 173 human cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia using whole-genome sequencing data and observe >50-fold variation. We then leverage the vast amount of genomics data available for these repositories to credential our resource and uncover mtDNA-related biology. Using already existing proteomics data, we show that variation in mtCN can be predicted by variation in TFAM, histone, and mitochondrial ribosome protein abundance. We also integrate mtCN estimates with the CRISPR gene dependency measurements to find that cell lines with high mtCN are resistant to loss of GPX4, a glutathione phospholipid hydroperoxidase. Our resource captures variation in mtCN across mammalian tissues and should be broadly useful to the research community.">

        <tr id="Tumors often show an initial response to chemotherapy, but then develop resistance, leading to relapse and poor prognosis. We hypothesized that a genomic comparison of mutations in pre-treated versus treatment-naive tumors would serve to identify genes that confer resistance. A challenge in such an analysis is that therapy alters mutation burdens and signatures, confounding association studies and complicating identifying causal, selected mutations. We developed DiffInvex, a framework for identifying changes in selection acting on individual genes in somatic genomes. Crucially, DiffInvex draws on a mutation rate baseline that accounts for these shifts in neutral mutagenesis during cancer evolution. We applied DiffInvex to 9,953 cancer whole-genomes from 29 cancer types from 8 studies, containing both WGS of treatment-naive tumors and tumors pre-treated by various drugs, identifying genes where point mutations are under conditional positive or negative selection for a certain chemotherapeutic, suggesting resistance mechanisms occurring via point mutation. DiffInvex confirmed well-known chemoresistance-driver mutations in EGFR, ESR1, KIT and AR genes as being under conditional positive selection, with additional cancer types identified for EGFR and KIT. Additionally, DiffInvex identified 11 genes with treatment-associated selection for different classes of therapeutics. In most cases, these genes were common cancer genes including PIK3CA, APC, MAP2K4 and MAP3K1. This suggests that tumor resistance to therapy via mutation often occurs via selective advantages conferred by known driver genes, rather than via mutations in specialized resistance genes. Various gene-chemotherapy associations were further supported in tests for functional impact of mutations, again implemented in a conditional selection setting, as well as replicating in independent panel or exome sequencing data. In addition to nominating drug resistance genes that could be targeted by future therapeutics, DiffInvex can also be applied to diverse analysis in cancer evolution, such as comparing normal and tumoral tissues, or analyzing subclonal evolution, identifying changes in selection over time.">

        <tr id="Although the study of leukemogenesis has traditionally focused on protein-coding genes, the role of enhancer dysregulation is becoming increasingly recognized. The advent of high-throughput sequencing, together with a better understanding of enhancer biology, has revealed how various genetic and epigenetic lesions produce oncogenic enhancers that drive transformation. These aberrations include translocations that lead to enhancer hijacking, point mutations that modulate enhancer activity, and copy number alterations that modify enhancer dosage. In this review, we describe these mechanisms in the context of leukemia and discuss potential therapeutic avenues to target these regulatory elements. Significance: Large-scale sequencing projects have uncovered recurrent gene mutations in leukemia, but the picture remains incomplete: some patients harbor no such aberrations, whereas others carry only a few that are insufficient to bring about transformation on their own. One of the missing pieces is enhancer dysfunction, which only recently has emerged as a critical driver of leukemogenesis. Knowledge of the various mechanisms of enhancer dysregulation is thus key for a complete understanding of leukemia and its causes, as well as the development of targeted therapies in the era of precision medicine.">

        <tr id="DNA methylation is a key epigenetic regulatory mechanism that plays a critical role in a variety of cellular processes, including the regulation of cell fate during development, maintenance of cell identity, and genome stability. DNA methylation is tightly regulated by enzymatic reactions and its deregulation plays an important role in the development of cancer. Specific DNA methylation alterations have been found in pediatric solid tumors, providing new insights into the development of these tumors. In addition, DNA methylation profiles have greatly contributed to tune the diagnosis of pediatric solid tumors and to define subgroups of patients with different risks of progression, leading to the reduction in unwanted toxicity and the improvement of treatment efficacy. This review highlights the dysregulated DNA methylome in pediatric solid tumors and how this information provides promising targets for epigenetic therapies, particularly inhibitors of DNMT enzymes (DNMTis). Opportunities and limitations are considered, including the ability of DNMTis to induce viral mimicry and immune signaling by tumors. Besides intrinsic action against cancer cells, DNMTis have the potential to sensitize immune-cold tumors to immunotherapies and may represent a remarkable option to improve the treatment of challenging pediatric solid tumors.">

        <tr id="The male mammalian germline is characterized by substantial chromatin remodeling associated with the transition from histones to protamines during spermatogenesis, followed by the reversal to nucleohistones in the male pronucleus preceding the zygotic genome activation. Both transitions are associated with the extensive formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), requiring an estimated 5 to 10 million transient DSBs per spermatozoa. Additionally, the high transcription rate in early stages of spermatogenesis leads to transcription-coupled damage preceding meiotic homologous recombination, potentially further contributing to the DSB landscape in mature spermatozoa. Once meiosis is completed, spermatozoa remain haploid and therefore cannot rely on error-free homologous recombination, but instead depend on error-prone classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ). This DNA damage/repair-scenario is proposed to be one of the main causes of the observed paternal mutation propensity in human evolution. Recent studies have shown that DSBs in the male pronucleus are repaired by maternally provided Polθ in Caenorhabditis elegans through Polθ-mediated end joining (TMEJ). Additionally, population genetic datasets have revealed a preponderance of TMEJ signatures associated with human variation. Since these signatures are the result of the combined effect of TMEJ and DSB formation in spermatozoa and male pronuclei, we used a BLISS-based protocol to analyze recurrent DSBs in mature human sperm heads as a proxy of the male pronucleus before zygotic chromatin remodeling. The DSBs were found to be enriched in (YR)n short tandem repeats and in evolutionarily young SINEs, reminiscent to patterns observed in murine spermatids, indicating evolutionary hotspots of recurrent DSB formation in mammalian spermatozoa. Additionally, we detected a similar DSB pattern in diploid human IMR90 cells when cNHEJ was selectively inhibited, indicating the significant impact of absent cNHEJ on the sperm DSB landscape. Strikingly, regions associated with most retained histones, and therefore less condensed chromatin, were not strongly enriched with recurrent DSBs. In contrast, the fraction of retained H3K27me3 in the mature spermatozoa displayed a strong association with recurrent DSBs. DSBs in H3K27me3 are associated with a preference for TMEJ over cNHEJ during repair. We hypothesize that the retained H3K27me3 may trigger transgenerational DNA repair by priming maternal Polθ to these regions.">

However, the characteristics of LCLs pose technical challenges to profiling immunoglobulin (IG) genes. IG loci in LCLs contain a mixture of germline and somatically recombined haplotypes, making them difficult to genotype or assemble accurately. To address these challenges, we introduce IGLoo, a software tool that implements novel methods for analyzing sequence data and genome assemblies derived from LCLs. IGLoo characterizes somatic V(D)J recombination events in the sequence data and identifies the breakpoints and missing IG genes in the LCL-based assemblies. Furthermore, IGLoo implements a novel reassembly framework to improve germline assembly quality by integrating information about somatic events and population structural variantions in the IG loci. We applied IGLoo to study the assemblies from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, providing new insights into the mechanisms, gene usage, and patterns of V(D)J recombination, causes of assembly fragmentation in the IG heavy chain (IGH) locus, and improved representation of the IGH assemblies.">

        <tr id="During the sexual cycle, programmed genome rearrangement (PGR) in Paramecium tetraurelia involves the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway to eliminate specific germinal Internal Eliminated Sequences (IESs) from the newly developing somatic nucleus. In addition to the core NHEJ factors Ku70/80 and Xrcc4/Lig4, additional enzymes are required to process the 4-base 5’-protruding ends generated following DNA cleavage at IES boundaries, prior to their ligation. Here, we report that PolX (a,b,c,d), four P. tetraurelia distant orthologs of the human Polλ DNA polymerase, are involved in repair of IES excision junctions. During rearrangements, PolX-depleted cells accumulate genome-wide errors, such as unrepaired double-strand breaks, 1-nucleotide deletions and IES retention. Although all PolX paralogs can process DNA ends, two of them (PolXa&b) are induced during PGR and have acquired tight nuclear anchoring properties through their N-terminal region, which contains a predicted BRCT domain. Finally, we show that PolXa accumulates in nuclear foci together with other NHEJ proteins and the Dicer-like enzyme Dcl5, which is involved in the biogenesis of IES-specific small RNAs. We propose that these “DNA repair foci” correspond to the sites where IES concatemers, a by-product of IES excision, are ligated together to produce the precursors of iesRNAs.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Germline mutations have been identified in a small number of hereditary cancers, but the genetic predisposition for many familial cancers remains to be elucidated. Methods This study identified a Chinese pedigree that presented different cancers (breast cancer, BRCA; adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction, AEG; and B‐cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B‐ALL) in each of the three generations. Whole‐genome sequencing and whole‐exome sequencing were performed on peripheral blood or bone marrow and cancer biopsy samples. Whole‐genome bisulfite sequencing was conducted on the monozygotic twin brothers, one of whom developed B‐ALL. Results According to the ACMG guidelines, bioinformatic analysis of the genome sequencing revealed 20 germline mutations, particularly mutations in the DNAH11 (c.9463G > A) and CFH (c.2314G > A) genes that were documented in the COSMIC database and validated by Sanger sequencing. Forty‐one common somatic mutated genes were identified in the cancer samples, displaying the same type of single nucleotide substitution Signature 5. Meanwhile, hypomethylation of PLEK2, MRAS, and RXRA as well as hypermethylation of CpG island associated with WT1 was shown in the twin with B‐ALL. Conclusions These findings reveal genomic alterations in a pedigree with multiple cancers. Mutations found in the DNAH11, CFH genes, and other genes predispose to malignancies in this family. Dysregulated methylation of WT1, PLEK2, MRAS, and RXRA in the twin with B‐ALL increases cancer susceptibility. The similarity of the somatic genetic changes among the three cancers indicates a hereditary impact on the pedigree. These familial cancers with germline and somatic mutations, as well as epigenomic alterations, represent a common molecular basis for many multiple cancer pedigrees.">

        <tr id="The centromeric protein-A (CENP-A) is an evolutionary conserved histone H3 variant that marks the identity of the centromeres. Several mechanisms regulate the centromeric deposition of CENP-A as its mislocalization causes erroneous chromosome segregation, leading to aneuploidy-based diseases, including cancers. The most crucial deposition factor is a CENP-A specific chaperone, HJURP (Scm3 in budding yeast), which specifically binds to CENP-A. However, the discovery of HJURP as a DDR (DNA damage repair) protein and evidence of its binding to Holliday junctions in vitro indicate a CENP-A-deposition-independent role of these chaperones. In this study, using budding yeast, we demonstrate that Scm3 is crucial for the DDR pathway as scm3 cells are sensitive to DNA damage. We further observe that the scm3 mutant interacts with the rad52 DDR mutant and is compromised in activating DDR-mediated arrest. We demonstrate that Scm3 associates with the DNA damage sites and undergoes posttranslational modifications upon DNA damage. Overall, from this report and earlier studies on HJURP, we conclude that DDR functions of CENP-A chaperones are conserved across eukaryotes. Thus, the revelation that these chaperones confer genome stability in more than one pathway has clinical significance.">

        <tr id="Premature aging is a hallmark of Down syndrome, caused by trisomy of human chromosome 21, but the reason is unclear and difficult to study in humans. We used an aneuploid model in wild yeast to show that chromosome amplification disrupts nutrient-induced cell-cycle arrest, quiescence entry, and healthy aging, across genetic backgrounds and amplified chromosomes. We discovered that these defects are due in part to aneuploidy-induced dysfunction in Ribosome Quality Control (RQC). Compared to euploids, aneuploids entering quiescence display aberrant ribosome profiles, accumulate RQC intermediates, and harbor an increased load of protein aggregates. Although they have normal proteasome capacity, aneuploids show signs of ubiquitin dysregulation, which impacts cyclin abundance to disrupt arrest. Remarkably, inducing ribosome stalling in euploids produces similar aberrations, while up-regulating limiting RQC subunits or proteins in ubiquitin metabolism alleviates many of the aneuploid defects. Our results provide implications for other aneuploidy disorders including Down syndrome.">

In this study, we identified 967 MB survival-related genes (SRGs) using a gene expression dataset and the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Notably, the SRGs were over-represented on chromosomes 6 and 17, known for the abnormalities monosomy 6 and isochromosome 17 in MB. The most significant SRG was HMGA1 (high mobility group AT-hook 1) on chromosome 6, which is a known oncogene and a histone H1 competitor. High expression of HMGA1 was associated with worse survival, primarily in the Group 3γ subtype. The high expression of HMGA1 was unrelated to any known somatic copy number alteration. Most SRGs on chromosome 17p were associated with low expression in Group 4β, the MB subtype, with 93% deletion of 17p and 98% copy gain of 17q. GO enrichment analysis showed that both chromosomes 6 and 17 included SRGs related to telomere maintenance and provided a rationale for testing telomerase inhibitors in Group 3 MBs. We conclude that HMGA1, along with other SRGs on chromosomes 6 and 17, warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic targets in selected subgroups or subtypes of MB.">

        <tr id="With age, hematopoietic stem cells can acquire somatic mutations in leukemogenic genes that confer a proliferative advantage in a phenomenon termed “clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential” (CHIP). How these mutations confer a proliferative advantage and result in increased risk for numerous age-related diseases remains poorly understood. We conducted a multiracial meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of CHIP and its subtypes in four cohorts (N=8196) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CHIP and illuminate how these changes influence cardiovascular disease risk. The EWAS findings were functionally validated using human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) models of CHIP. A total of 9615 CpGs were associated with any CHIP, 5990 with DNMT3A CHIP, 5633 with TET2 CHIP, and 6078 with ASXL1 CHIP (P <1×10−7). CpGs associated with CHIP subtypes overlapped moderately, and the genome-wide DNA methylation directions of effect were opposite for TET2 and DNMT3A CHIP, consistent with their opposing effects on global DNA methylation. There was high directional concordance between the CpGs shared from the meta-EWAS and human edited CHIP HSCs. Expression quantitative trait methylation analysis further identified transcriptomic changes associated with CHIP-associated CpGs. Causal inference analyses revealed 261 CHIP-associated CpGs associated with cardiovascular traits and all-cause mortality (FDR adjusted p-value <0.05). Taken together, our study sheds light on the epigenetic changes impacted by CHIP and their associations with age-related disease outcomes. The novel genes and pathways linked to the epigenetic features of CHIP may serve as therapeutic targets for preventing or treating CHIP-mediated diseases.">

        <tr id="Whole-genome (WG) abnormalities, such as uniparental diploidy and triploidy, cause fetal death. Occasionally, they coexist with biparental diploid cells in live births. Understanding the origin and early development of WG abnormal blastomeres is crucial for explaining the formation of androgenotes, gynogenotes, triploidy, chimerism, and mixoploidy. By haplotyping 118 blastomeres from first cleavages, we identified various mechanisms of heterogoneic divisions that lead to WG abnormal blastomeres or their coexistence with normal blastomeres in both multipolar and bipolar cleaving zygotes. After culturing the totipotent blastomeres to three preimplantation stages and performing transcriptome profiling on over 600 cells, we discovered that stress responses contribute to developmental impairment in WG abnormal cells, resulting in either cell arrest or blastocyst formation. However, first-cleavage-derived WG abnormal blastomeres can survive early development and progress to blastocysts. Their potential dominance in preimplantation embryos represents an overlooked cause of abnormal development. Haplotype based screening could further increase pregnancy rates.">

By exploring the current state of the field, we identify and describe the central mechanisms that determine sarcomagenesis. Further, we discuss seminal studies in translational genomics, which enabled epigenetic characterization of fusion-driven sarcomas. Important context for epigenetic mechanisms include, but are not limited to, cell cycle and metabolism, core regulatory circuitry, 3-dimensional chromatin architectural dysregulation, integration with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, and translational animal modeling. Paradoxically, while the genetic requirements for oncogenic transformation are highly specific for the fusion partners, the epigenetic mechanisms we as a community have uncovered are categorically very broad. This dichotomy prompts the question of whether the investigation of rare disease epigenomics should prioritize studying individual cell populations, thereby examining whether the mechanisms of chromatin dysregulation are specific to a particular tumor. We review recent advances focusing on rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, undifferentiated round cell sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, myxoid/round liposarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and desmoplastic round cell tumor. The growing number of groundbreaking discoveries in the field, motivated us to anticipate further exciting advances in the area of mechanistic epigenomics and direct targeting of fusion transcription factors in the years ahead.">

        <tr id="The myeloma overexpressed gene (MYEOV) has been proposed to be a proto-oncogene due to high RNA transcript levels found in multiple cancers, including myeloma, breast, lung, pancreas and esophageal cancer. The presence of an open reading frame (ORF) in humans and other primates suggests protein-coding potential. Yet, we still lack evidence of a functional MYEOV protein. It remains undetermined how MYEOV overexpression affects cancerous tissues. In this work, we show that MYEOV has likely originated and may still function as an enhancer, regulating CCND1 and LTO1. Firstly, MYEOV 3′ enhancer activity was confirmed in humans using publicly available ATAC-STARR-seq data, performed on B-cell-derived GM12878 cells. We detected enhancer histone marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac overlapping MYEOV in multiple healthy human tissues, which include B cells, liver and lung tissue. The analysis of 3D genome datasets revealed chromatin interactions between a MYEOV-3′-putative enhancer and the proto-oncogene CCND1. BLAST searches and multi-sequence alignment results showed that DNA sequence from this human enhancer element is conserved from the amphibians/amniotes divergence, with a 273 bp conserved region also found in all mammals, and even in chickens, where it is consistently located near the corresponding CCND1 orthologues. Furthermore, we observed conservation of an active enhancer state in the MYEOV orthologues of four non-human primates, dogs, rats, and mice. When studying this homologous region in mice, where the ORF of MYEOV is absent, we not only observed an enhancer chromatin state but also found interactions between the mouse enhancer homolog and Ccnd1 using 3D-genome interaction data. This is similar to the interaction observed in humans and, interestingly, coincides with CTCF binding sites in both species. Taken together, this suggests that MYEOV is a primate-specific gene with a de novo ORF that originated at an evolutionarily older enhancer region. This deeply conserved putative enhancer element could regulate CCND1 in both humans and mice, opening the possibility of studying MYEOV regulatory functions in cancer using non-primate animal models.">

        <tr id="Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children, yet few environmental risk factors have been identified. We previously found an association between early-life tobacco smoke exposure and frequency of somatic deletions of 8 leukemia driver genes among childhood ALL patients in the California Childhood Leukemia Study. To expand analysis genome-wide and examine potential mechanisms, we conducted tumor whole-genome sequencing in 35 ALL patients, including 18 with high prenatal tobacco exposure and 17 with low exposure as determined by established epigenetic biomarkers. High tobacco exposure patients had significantly more structural variants (P < .001) and deletions (P = .001) genome-wide than low exposure patients. Investigation of off-target RAG recombination revealed that 41% of deletions in the high tobacco exposure patients were putatively RAG-mediated (full RAG motif identified at one or both breakpoints) compared with only 21% in the low exposure group (P = .001). In a multilevel model, deletions in high tobacco exposure patients were 2.44-fold (95% CI:1.13–5.38) more likely to be putatively RAG-mediated than deletions in low exposure patients. No point mutational signatures were associated with prenatal tobacco exposure. Our findings suggest that early-life tobacco smoke exposure may promote leukemogenesis by driving development of somatic deletions in pre-leukemic lymphocytes via off-target RAG recombination.">

        <tr id="Telomeric DNA, composed of short, direct repeats, is of crucial importance for chromosome stability. Due to intrinsic problems with replicating this DNA, the repeat tracts shorten at each cell division. Once repeat tracts become critically short, a telomeric stress signal induces cellular senescence and division arrest, which eventually may lead to devastating age-related degenerative diseases associated with dysfunctional telomers. Conversely, maintenance of telomere length by telomerase upregulation is a hallmark of cancer. Therefore, telomere length is a critical determinant of telomere function. How telomere length is established and molecular mechanisms for telomere-specific length regulation remained unknown. Here we show that subtelomeric chromatin is a determinant for how telomere equilibrium set-length is established in cis. The results demonstrate that telomerase recruitment mediated by the telomere-associated Sir4 protein is modulated on chromosome 3L in a telomere-specific way. Increased Sir4 abundance on subtelomeric heterochromatin of this specific telomere leads to telomere lengthening of only that telomere in cis, but not at other telomeres. Therefore, this work describes a mechanism for a how telomere-specific repeat tract length can be established. Further, our results will force the evaluation of telomere length away from a generalized view to a more telomere-specific consideration.">

        <tr id="Summary From RNA interference to chromatin silencing, diverse genome defense pathways silence selfish genetic elements to safeguard genome integrity1,2. Despite their diversity, different defense pathways share a modular organization, where numerous specificity factors identify diverse targets and common effectors silence them. In the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, which controls selfish elements in the metazoan germline, diverse target RNAs are first identified by complementary base pairing with piRNAs and then silenced by PIWI-clade nucleases via enzymatic cleavage1,3. Such a binary architecture allows the defense systems to be readily adaptable, where new targets can be captured via the innovation of new specificity factors4,5. Thus, our current understanding of genome defense against lineage-specific selfish genes has been largely limited to the evolution of specificity factors, while it remains poorly understood whether other types of innovations are required. Here, we describe a new type of innovation, which escalates the defense capacity of the piRNA pathway to control a recently expanded selfish gene in Drosophila melanogaster. Through an in vivo RNAi screen for repressors of Stellate—a recently evolved and expanded selfish meiotic driver6–8—we discovered a novel defense factor, Trailblazer. Trailblazer is a transcription factor that promotes the expression of two PIWI-clade nucleases, Aub and AGO3, to match Stellate in abundance. Recent innovation in the DNA-binding domain of Trailblazer enabled it to drastically elevate Aub and AGO3 expression in the D. melanogaster lineage, thereby escalating the silencing capacity of the piRNA pathway to control expanded Stellate and safeguard fertility. As copy-number expansion is a recurrent feature of diverse selfish genes across the tree of life9–12, we envision that augmenting the defense capacity to quantitatively match selfish genes is likely a repeatedly employed defense strategy in evolution.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
Ionizing radiation generates genomic instability by promoting the accumulation of chromosomal rearrangements. The oncogenic translocation RET/PTC1 is present in more than 70% of radiation-induced thyroid cancers. Both RET and CCDC6, the genes implicated in RET/PTC1, are found within common fragile sites - chromosomal regions prone to DNA breakage during slight replication stress. Given that irradiated cells become more susceptible to genomic destabilization due to the accumulation of replication-stress-related double-strand breaks (DSBs), we explored whether RET and CCDC6 exhibit DNA breakage under replicative stress several days post-irradiation of thyroid cells.


METHODS
We analyzed the dynamic of DNA replication in human thyroid epithelial cells (HThy-ori-3.1) 4 days post a 5-Gy exposure using molecular DNA combing. The DNA replication schedule was evaluated through replication-timing experiments. We implemented a ChIP-qPCR assay to determine whether the RET and CCDC6 genes break following irradiation.


RESULTS
Our study indicates that replicative stress, occurring several days post-irradiation in thyroid cells, primarily causes DSBs in the RET gene. We discovered that both the RET and CCDC6 genes undergo late replication in thyroid cells. However, only RET's replication rate is notably delayed after irradiation.


CONCLUSION
The findings suggest that post-irradiation in the RET gene causes a breakage in the replication fork, which could potentially invade another genomic area, including CCDC6. As a result, this could greatly contribute to the high prevalence of chromosomal RET/PTC rearrangements seen in patients exposed to external radiation.">

        <tr id="Endothelial cells (ECs) maintain vessel tone and barrier integrity, regulate blood homeostasis, and prevent the extravasation of leukocytes under normal physiological conditions. Because of the limited lifespans and batch-to-batch differences with respect to the genetic make-up of primary ECs, established immortal EC lines are extensively used for studying endothelial biology. To address this issue, the immortal endothelial cell line EA.hy926 was developed by fusing primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with human lung carcinoma A549 cells. EA.hy926 cells share a number of similar endothelial properties with HUVECs and are considered the immortal counterpart to primary HUVECs. However, the cytogenetic integrity of EA.hy926 cells is not fully elucidated. We characterized EA.hy926 cells with conventional G-banding and molecular cytogenetic techniques such as spectral karyotyping and subtelomeric fluorescence in situ hybridization. Cytogenetic analysis revealed an array of numerical and stable structural chromosomal rearrangements including one deletion, one duplication, one isochromosome, seven simple translocations, and five complex translocations in Ea.hy926 cells. These findings will advance comprehension of EA.hy926 cell biology and augment future endothelial studies, specifically in comparison studies between HUVECs and EA.hy926 cells.">

        <tr id="Each piece of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has a length determined by the exact metabolic conditions in the cell it belonged to at the time of cell death. The changes in cellular regulation leading to a variety of patterns, which are based on the different number of fragments with lengths up to several hundred base pairs at each of the almost three billion genomic positions, allow for the detection of disease and also the precise identification of the tissue of their origin. A Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence computation identifies different fragment lengths and areas of the human genome, depending on the stage, for which disease samples, starting from pre-clinical disease stages, diverge from healthy donor samples. We provide examples of genes related to colorectal cancer (CRC), which our algorithm detected to belong to divergent genomic bins. The staging of CRC can be viewed as a Markov Chain and that provides a framework for studying disease progression and the types of epigenetic changes occurring longitudinally at each stage, which might aid the correct classification of a new hospital sample. In a new look to treat such data as grayscale value images, pattern recognition using artificial intelligence (AI) could be one approach to classification. In CRC, Stage I disease does not, for the most part, shed any tumor circulation, making detection difficult for established machine learning (ML) methods. This leads to the deduction that early detection, where we can only rely on changes in the metabolic patterns, can be accomplished when the information is considered in its entirety, for example by applying computer vision methods.">

        <tr id="Repairing programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is crucial in the lifecycle of Paramecium tetraurelia, especially during its sexual reproduction phase when its somatic highly polyploid macronucleus is lost. The formation of a new macronucleus involves Programmed Genome Rearrangements, introducing DNA DSBs at approximately 45,000 loci. P. tetraurelia employs a Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)-related mechanism for the systematic repair of these DSBs. Four genes encoding DNA polymerases of family X are present in the genome, one of which was found recently to colocalize with other proteins of NHEJ. The question arises as to how they make almost no error. Here we show that these enzymes are most similar to metazoan DNA polymerase λ and exhibit high fidelity through two different molecular mechanisms. Using X-ray structure determination of polymerase lambda mutants recapitulating sequence determinants of P. tetraurelia PolXs, we find both a local conformational change that involves exchanging partners in a crucial salt bridge in the active site upon binding of correct dNTPs, and a larger conformational change involving the closure of Loop3. This stabilizes the template DNA in the active site, only in the presence of the correct incoming dNTP. Differences with human pol λ and pol β are discussed. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT">

        <tr id="Cancer is a heterogeneous disease that results from genetic alteration of cell cycle and proliferation controls. Identifying mutations that drive cancer, understanding cancer type specificities, and delineating how driver mutations interact with each other to establish disease is vital for identifying therapeutic vulnerabilities. Such cancer specific patterns and gene co-occurrences can be identified by studying tumor genome sequences, and networks have proven effective in uncovering relationships between sequences. We present two network-based approaches to identify driver gene patterns among tumor samples. The first approach relies on analysis using the Directed Weighted All Nearest Neighbors (DiWANN) model, which is a variant of sequence similarity network, and the second approach uses bipartite network analysis. A data reduction framework was implemented to extract the minimal relevant information for the sequence similarity network analysis, where a transformed reference sequence is generated for constructing the driver gene network. This data reduction process combined with the efficiency of the DiWANN network model, greatly lowered the computational cost (in terms of execution time and memory usage) of generating the networks enabling us to work at a much larger scale than previously possible. The DiWANN network helped us identify cancer types in which samples were more closely connected to each other suggesting they are less heterogeneous and potentially susceptible to a common drug. The bipartite network analysis provided insight into gene associations and co-occurrences. We identified genes that were broadly mutated in multiple cancer types and mutations exclusive to only a few. Additionally, weighted one-mode gene projections of the bipartite networks revealed a pattern of occurrence of driver genes in different cancers. Our study demonstrates that network-based approaches can be an effective tool in cancer genomics. The analysis identifies co-occurring and exclusive driver genes and mutations for specific cancer types, providing a better understanding of the driver genes that lead to tumor initiation and evolution.">

        <tr id="Whole-genome sequencing efforts has during the past decade unveiled the central role of genomic rearrangements—such as chromosomal inversions—in evolutionary processes, including local adaptation in a wide range of taxa. However, employment of reference genomes from distantly or even closely related species for mapping and the subsequent variant calling, can lead to errors and/or biases in the datasets generated for downstream analyses. Here, we capitalize on the recently generated chromosome-anchored genome assemblies for Arctic cod (Arctogadus glacialis), polar cod (Boreogadus saida), and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) to evaluate the extent and consequences of reference bias on population sequencing datasets (approx. 15-20x coverage) for both Arctic cod and polar cod. Our findings demonstrate that the choice of reference genome impacts population genetic statistics, including individual mapping depth, heterozygosity levels, and cross-species comparisons of nucleotide diversity (π) and genetic divergence (DXY). Further, it became evident that using a more distantly related reference genome can lead to inaccurate detection and characterization of chromosomal inversions, i.e., in terms of size (length) and location (position), due to inter-chromosomal reorganizations between species. Additionally, we observe that several of the detected species-specific inversions were split into multiple genomic regions when mapped towards a heterospecific reference. Inaccurate identification of chromosomal rearrangements as well as biased population genetic measures could potentially lead to erroneous interpretation of species-specific genomic diversity, impede the resolution of local adaptation, and thus, impact predictions of their genomic potential to respond to climatic and other environmental perturbations.">

        <tr id="Epigenetic modifications to DNA and chromatin control oncogenic and tumor suppressive mechanisms in melanoma. EZH2, the catalytic component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which mediates methylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3), can regulate both melanoma initiation and progression. We previously found that mutant Ezh2Y641F interacts with the immune regulator Stat3 and together they affect anti-tumor immunity. However, given the numerous downstream targets and pathways affected by EZH2, many mechanisms that determine its oncogenic activity remain largely unexplored. Using genetically engineered mouse models we further investigated the role of pathways downstream of EZH2 in melanoma carcinogenesis and identified significant enrichment in several autophagy signatures, along with increased expression of autophagy regulators, such as Atg7. In this study, we investigated the effect of Atg7 on melanoma growth and tumor immunity within the context of an Ezh2Y641F epigenetic state. We found that expression of Atg7 is largely dependent on Stat3 expression and that deletion of Atg7 slows down melanoma cell growth in vivo, but not in vitro. Atg7 deletion also results in increased CD8+ T cells and reduced myelosuppressive cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting a strong immune system contribution in the role of Atg7 in melanoma progression. These findings highlight the complex interplay between genetic mutations, epigenetic regulators, and autophagy in shaping tumor immunity in melanoma.">

The PND model suggests a plausible role of the tumor antigen expression in tumor suppression, whereas it has emerged that NOVA may function as an oncogene in a variety of cancers. In addition, whether NOVA mediates AS in breast cancer remains unanswered. Here we examine the AS profiles of breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) tumor samples and demonstrate that ectopic NOVA1 expression led to the activation of neuron-like splicing patterns in many genes, including exons targeted by NOVA in the brain. The splicing dysregulation is especially prevalent in cell periphery and cytoskeleton genes related to cell-cell communication, actin-based movement, and neuronal functions. We find that NOVA1-mediated AS is most prominent in Luminal A tumors and high NOVA1 expression in this subtype is associated with poorer prognosis. Our results suggest that ectopic NOVA1 in tumors has regulatory activity affecting pathways with high relevance to tumor progression and that this might be a more general mechanism for PND antigens.">

        <tr id="Gene expression regulation is one of the most fundamental cellular processes, enabling the activation of a gene to produce either the translatable protein-coding transcript (mRNA) or a functional non-coding RNA with gene regulatory functions, ultimately determining cell identity and function. Although gene expression regulation can occur at transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels, transcription initiation is the first and the most important step in gene expression, facilitating the transfer of biological information from DNA to protein. Enhancers and super-enhancers are among the master regulators of tissue- and cell-specific transcription regulation involved in cell differentiation and tumor formation. Despite four decades passing since the first discovery of enhancers in eukaryotes and extensive efforts undertaken to identify enhancers on a genomic scale during the last decade, the discovery of enhancers still faces certain limitations and needs further investigation. The perturbation of enhancer function due to genetic or epigenetic changes is closely linked to a range of human disorders, including the development and progression of cancers. Thus, the detection of early cancer-related enhancer activity and the subsequent normalization of expression abnormalities using enhancer-targeting CRISPR epigenetic editing, as well as enhancer-targeting pharmaceuticals, are regarded as groundbreaking therapeutic tactics in preclinical stages.">

        <tr id="In recent years, there has been increased focus on exploring the role the non-protein-coding genome plays in Mendelian disorders. One class of particular interest is long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which has recently been implicated in the regulation of diverse molecular processes. However, because lncRNAs do not encode protein, there is uncertainty regarding what constitutes a pathogenic lncRNA variant, and thus annotating such elements is challenging. The Developmental Genome Anatomy Project (DGAP) and similar projects recruit individuals with apparently balanced chromosomal abnormalities (BCAs) that disrupt or dysregulate genes in order to annotate the human genome. We hypothesized that rearrangements disrupting lncRNAs could be the underlying genetic etiology for the phenotypes of a subset of these individuals. Thus, we assessed 279 cases with BCAs and selected 191 cases with simple BCAs (breakpoints at only two genomic locations) for further analysis of lncRNA disruptions. From these, we identified 66 cases in which the chromosomal rearrangements directly disrupt lncRNAs. Strikingly, the lncRNAs MEF2C-AS1 and ENSG00000257522 are each disrupted in two unrelated cases. Furthermore, in 30 cases, no genes of any other class aside from lncRNAs are directly disrupted, consistent with the hypothesis that lncRNA disruptions could underly the phenotypes of these individuals. To showcase the power of this genomic approach for annotating lncRNAs, here we focus on clinical reports and genetic analysis of two individuals with BCAs and additionally highlight six individuals with likely developmental etiologies due to lncRNA disruptions.">

        <tr id="Medulloblastoma (MB) stands as one of the prevalent malignant brain tumors among pediatric patients. Despite its prevalence, the intricate interplay between the regulatory program driving malignancy in MB cells and their interactions with the microenvironment remains insufficiently understood. Leveraging the capabilities of single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq), the chromatin accessibility landscape is unveiled across 59,015 distinct MB cells. This expansive dataset encompasses cells belonging to discrete molecular subgroups, namely SHH, WNT, Group3, and Group4. Within these chromatin accessibility profiles, specific regulatory elements tied to individual subgroups are uncovered, shedding light on the distinct activities of transcription factors (TFs) that likely orchestrate the tumorigenesis process. Moreover, it is found that certain neurotransmitter receptors (NTRs) are subgroup-specific and can predict MB subgroup classification when combined with their associated transcription factors. Notably, targeting essential NTRs within tumors influences both the in vitro sphere-forming capability and the in vivo tumorigenic capacity of MB cells. These findings collectively provide fresh insights into comprehending the regulatory networks and cellular dynamics within MBs. Furthermore, the significance of the TF-NTR regulatory circuits is underscored as prospective biomarkers and viable therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Genome editing is poised to revolutionize treatment of genetic diseases, but poor understanding and control of DNA repair outcomes hinders its therapeutic potential. DNA repair is especially understudied in nondividing cells like neurons, which must withstand decades of DNA damage without replicating. This lack of knowledge limits the efficiency and precision of genome editing in clinically relevant cells. To address this, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neurons to examine how postmitotic human neurons repair Cas9-induced DNA damage. We discovered that neurons can take weeks to fully resolve this damage, compared to just days in isogenic iPSCs. Furthermore, Cas9-treated neurons upregulated unexpected DNA repair genes, including factors canonically associated with replication. Manipulating this response with chemical or genetic perturbations allowed us to direct neuronal repair toward desired editing outcomes. By studying DNA repair in postmitotic human cells, we uncovered unforeseen challenges and opportunities for precise therapeutic editing.">

        <tr id="Cancer genomic studies have identified frequent alterations in components of the SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose Non- Fermenting) chromatin remodeling complex including SMARCA4 and ARID1A. Importantly, clinical reports indicate that SMARCA4-mutant lung cancers respond poorly to immunotherapy and have dismal prognosis. However, the mechanistic basis of immunotherapy resistance is unknown. Here, we corroborated the clinical findings by using immune-humanized, syngeneic, and genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer harboring SMARCA4 deficiency. Specifically, we show that SMARCA4 loss caused decreased response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy associated with significantly reduced infiltration of dendritic cells (DCs) and CD4+ T cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME). Mechanistically, we show that SMARCA4 loss in tumor cells led to profound downregulation of STING, IL1β and other components of the innate immune system as well as inflammatory cytokines that are required for efficient recruitment and activity of immune cells. We establish that this deregulation of gene expression is caused by cancer cell-intrinsic reprogramming of the enhancer landscape with marked loss of chromatin accessibility at enhancers of genes involved in innate immune response such as STING, IL1β, type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, we observed that transcription factor NF-κB binding motif was highly enriched in enhancers that lose accessibility upon SMARCA4 deficiency. Finally, we confirmed that SMARCA4 and NF-κB co-occupy the same genomic loci on enhancers associated with STING and IL1β, indicating a functional interplay between SMARCA4 and NF-κB. Taken together, our findings provide the mechanistic basis for the poor response of SMARCA4-mutant tumors to anti-PD1 immunotherapy and establish a functional link between SMARCA4 and NF-κB on innate immune and inflammatory gene expression regulation.">

        <tr id="TBC1D3 is a primate-specific gene family that has expanded in the human lineage and has been implicated in neuronal progenitor proliferation and expansion of the frontal cortex. The gene family and its expression have been challenging to investigate because it is embedded in high-identity and highly variable segmental duplications. We sequenced and assembled the gene family using long-read sequencing data from 34 humans and 11 non-human primate species. Our analysis shows that this particular gene family has independently duplicated in at least five primate lineages, and the duplicated loci are enriched at sites of large-scale chromosomal rearrangements on Chromosome 17. We find that all human copy number variation maps to two distinct clusters located at Chromosome 17q12 and that humans are highly structurally variable at this locus, differing by as many as 20 copies and ~1 Mbp in length depending on haplotypes. We also show evidence of positive selection, as well as a significant change in the predicted human TBC1D3 protein sequence. Lastly, we find that, despite multiple duplications, human TBC1D3 expression is limited to a subset of copies and, most notably, from a single paralog group: TBC1D3-CDKL These observations may help explain why a gene potentially important in cortical development can be so variable in the human population.">

        <tr id="The genomic landscape of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has a considerable intra-tumor heterogeneity, which is a significant obstacle in the field of precision oncology and plays a pivotal role in metastasis, recurrence, and therapeutic resistance of cancer. The mechanisms of intra-tumor heterogeneity in ccRCC have yet to be fully established. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) data from a single-cell multi-omics perspective. Based on consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) algorithm, functionally heterogeneous cancer cells were classified into metabolism, inflammatory, and EMT meta programs, with spatial transcriptomics sequencing (stRNA-seq) providing spatial information of such disparate meta programs of cancer cells. The bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed high clinical prognostic values of functionally heterogeneous cancer cells of three meta programs, with transcription factor regulatory network and motif activities revealing the key transcription factors that regulate functionally heterogeneous ccRCC cells. The interactions between varying meta programs and other cell subpopulations in the microenvironment were investigated. Finally, we assessed the sensitivity of cancer cells of disparate meta programs to different anti-cancer agents. Our findings inform on the intra-tumor heterogeneity of ccRCC and its regulatory networks and offers new perspectives to facilitate the designs of rational therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="The significance of p53’s primary and secondary tumor suppressor programs cannot be overstated. A context- and stress-dependent transcription factor, p53 accumulates to mount its most well-characterized programs in response to a variety of stressors, most notably DNA damage. As cells and tissues never exist in a complete absence of stress, a small amount of p53 exists in cells under physiologic stress, detectable by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing, termed basal p53. Recently, we and others have shown that basal p53 is sufficient to regulate tumor suppressor function. Furthermore, others have suggested the possibility that p53 accumulation in response to experimental stress may be dispensable for its tumor suppression. We previously showed basal p53 occupancy and regulation of known tumor suppressor genes, including PTEN and PHLDA3, in non-transformed breast cells, but this study was limited by experimental stress inherent to cell culture. Given the lack of global characterization of the basal p53 landscape under non-malignant physiologic stress in vivo, we utilized a multi-omics approach to define the murine basal p53 epigenome and its transcriptional program in various normal murine tissues. In this study, we observed basal p53 binding to cis regions of multiple tumor suppressor genes in different tissues, of which some showed p53-dependent regulation of their expression, including Phlda3, Bbc3, Xaf1, and itself. Furthermore, the vast majority of basal p53 target genes were not induced upon irradiation, suggesting basal p53 operates a transcriptional program that is largely distinct from its DNA damage response. Similarly, the basal p53 target gene repertoire is unique to each tissue type.">

In screening experiments, we found that circPCMTD1 depletion strongly inhibited the proliferative capacity of leukemic cells with BCR-ABL translocations. Mass cytometry experiments identified the aberrant activation of the DNA damage response as an early downstream event of circPCMTD1 depletion. In in vivo experiments, circPCMTD1 targeting prolonged the survival of mice engrafted with leukemic blasts harboring the Philadelphia chromosome. Mechanistically, we found that circPCMTD1 was enriched in the cytoplasm and associated with the ribosomes of the leukemic cells. We detected a cryptic open reading frame within the circPCMTD1 sequence and found that circPCMTD1 could generate a peptide product. The circPCMTD1-derived peptide interacted with proteins of the BTR complex and enhanced BTR complex formation, thereby increasing tolerance to genotoxic stress.">

        <tr id="Replication stress (RS) is a key trait of cancer cells, and a potential actionable target in cancer treatment. Accurate methods to measure RS in tumour samples are currently lacking. DNA fibre analysis has been used as a common technique to measure RS in cell lines. Here, we investigated DNA fibre analysis on fresh breast cancer specimens and correlated DNA replication kinetics to known RS markers and genomic alterations. Fresh, treatment-naïve primary breast cancer samples (n = 74) were subjected to ex vivo DNA fibre analysis to measure DNA replication kinetics. Tumour cell proliferation was confirmed by EdU incorporation and cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (CK) staining. The RS markers phospho-S33-RPA and γH2AX and the RS-inducing proto-oncogenes Cyclin E1 and c-Myc were analysed by immunohistochemistry. Copy number variations (CNVs) were assessed from genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. We found that the majority of proliferating (EdU-positive) cells in each sample were CK-positive and therefore considered to be tumour cells. DNA fibre lengths varied largely in most tumour samples. The median DNA fibre length showed a significant inverse correlation with pRPA expression (r = -0.29, p = 0.033) but was not correlated with Cyclin E1 or c-Myc expression and global CNVs in this study. Nuclear Cyclin E1 expression showed a positive correlation with pRPA levels (r = 0.481, p < 0.0001), while cytoplasmic Cyclin E1 expression exhibited an inverse association with pRPA expression (r = -0.353, p = 0.002) and a positive association with global CNVs (r = 0.318, p = 0.016). In conclusion, DNA fibre analysis performed with fresh primary breast cancer samples is feasible. Fibre lengths were associated with pRPA expression. Cyclin E1 expression was associated with pRPA and the percentage of CNVs. © 2024 The Author(s).

        <tr id="CRNDE is an oncogene expressed as a long non-coding RNA. However, our team previously reported that the CRNDE gene also encodes a micropeptide, CRNDEP. The amino acid sequence of CRNDEP has recently been revealed by other researchers, too. This study aimed to investigate genetic alterations within the CRNDEP-coding region of the CRNDE gene, methylation profiling of this gene, and CRNDEP expression analysis. All investigations were performed on clinical material from patients with ovarian tumors of diverse aggressiveness. We found that CRNDEP levels were significantly elevated in highly aggressive tumors compared to benign neoplasms. Consistently, a high level of this micropeptide was a negative, independent, prognostic, and predictive factor in high-grade ovarian cancer (hgOvCa) patients. The cancer-promoting role of CRNDE(P), shown in our recent study, was also supported by genetic and epigenetic results obtained herein, revealing no CRNDEP-disrupting mutations in any clinical sample. Moreover, in borderline ovarian tumors (BOTS), but not in ovarian cancers, the presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism in CRNDE, rs115515594, significantly increased the risk of recurrence. Consistently, in BOTS only, the same genetic variant was highly overrepresented compared to healthy individuals. We also discovered that hypomethylation of CRNDE is associated with increased aggressiveness of ovarian tumors. Accordingly, hypomethylation of this gene’s promoter/first exon correlated with hgOvCa resistance to chemotherapy, but only in specimens with accumulation of the TP53 tumor suppressor protein. Taken together, these results contribute to a better understanding of the role of CRNDE(P) in tumorigenesis and potentially may lead to improvements in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of ovarian neoplasms.">

        <tr id="Single-strand breaks (SSBs) are one of the most common endogenous lesions and have the potential to give rise to cytotoxic double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication. To investigate the mechanism of replication fork collapse at SSBs and subsequent repair, we employed Cas9 nickase (nCas9) to generate site and strand-specific nicks in the budding yeast genome. We show that nCas9-induced nicks are converted to mostly double-ended DSBs during S-phase. We find that repair of replication-dependent DSBs requires homologous recombination (HR) and is independent of canonical non-homologous end joining. Consistent with a strong bias to repair these lesions using a sister chromatid template, we observe minimal induction of inter-chromosomal HR by nCas9. Using nCas9 and a gRNA to nick either the leading or lagging strand template, we carried out a genome-wide screen to identify factors necessary for the repair of replication-dependent DSBs. All the core HR genes were recovered in the screen with both gRNAs, but we recovered components of the replication-coupled nucleosome assembly (RCNA) pathway with only the gRNA targeting the leading strand template. By use of additional gRNAs, we find that the RCNA pathway is especially important to repair a leading strand fork collapse.">

Yet, how the cooperation of these genome-wide, epigenetic marks determine unique transcriptional signatures across different brain cell populations is unclear. Here we applied Nanopore sequencing of native DNA to obtain a complete, genome-wide, single-base resolution atlas of 5mC and 5hmC modifications in neurons, astrocytes and microglia in the mouse cortex (99% genome coverage, 40 million CpG sites).

        <tr id="Abstract The DNA‐dependent protein kinase (DNA‐PK), catalytic subunit, also known as DNA‐PKcs, is complexed with the heterodimer Ku70/Ku80 to form DNA‐PK holoenzyme, which is well recognized as initiator in the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair after double strand break (DSB). During NHEJ, DNA‐PKcs is essential for both DNA end processing and end joining. Besides its classical function in DSB repair, DNA‐PKcs also shows multifaceted functions in various biological activities such as class switch recombination (CSR) and variable (V) diversity (D) joining (J) recombination in B/T lymphocytes development, innate immunity through cGAS–STING pathway, transcription, alternative splicing, and so on, which are dependent on its function in NHEJ or not. Moreover, DNA‐PKcs deficiency has been proven to be related with human diseases such as neurological pathogenesis, cancer, immunological disorder, and so on through different mechanisms. Therefore, it is imperative to summarize the latest findings about DNA‐PKcs and diseases for better targeting DNA‐PKcs, which have shown efficacy in cancer treatment in preclinical models. Here, we discuss the multifaceted roles of DNA‐PKcs in human diseases, meanwhile, we discuss the progresses of DNA‐PKcs inhibitors and their potential in clinical trials. The most updated review about DNA‐PKcs will hopefully provide insights and ideas to understand DNA‐PKcs associated diseases.">

Where is the boundary of the human PAR1? We first review the evidence that mapped the PAR boundary, or PAB, before the human genome draft sequence was produced, then examine post-genomic datasets for evidence of crossing-over between the X and Y, and lastly re-examine the sequence assemblies presented by Hallast and colleagues to see whether they support a more distal PAB. We find ample evidence of X-Y crossovers throughout the 500 kb in question, some as close as 246 bp to the previously reported PAB. Our new analyses, combined with previous studies over the past 40 years, provide overwhelming evidence to support the original position, and narrow the probable location of the PAB to a 201-bp window.">

        <tr id="DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3) is a transcription factor central to apoptosis, differentiation, and stress response. DDIT3 has been extensively studied in cancer biology. However, its precise implications in breast cancer progression and its interaction with the immune microenvironment are unclear. In this study, we utilized a novel multi-omics integration strategy, combining bulk RNA sequencing, single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry, to explore the role of DDIT3 in breast cancer and establish the correlation between DDIT3 and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. We identified a robust prognostic signature, including six genes (unc-93 homolog B1, TLR signaling regulator, anti-Mullerian hormone, DCTP pyrophosphatase 1, mitochondrial ribosomal protein L36, nuclear factor erythroid 2, and Rho GTPase activating protein 39), associated with DDIT3. This signature stratified the high-risk patient groups, characterized by increased infiltration of the regulatory T cells and M2-like macrophages and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/FGF receptor signaling activation. Notably, the high-risk patient group demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to immunotherapy, presenting novel therapeutic opportunities. Integrating multi-omics data helped determine the spatial expression pattern of DDIT3 in the tumor microenvironment and its correlation with immune cell infiltration. This multi-dimensional analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between DDIT3 and the immune microenvironment in breast cancer. Overall, our study not only facilitates understanding the role of DDIT3 in breast cancer but also offers innovative insights for developing prognostic models and therapeutic strategies. Identifying the DDIT3-related prognostic signature and its association with the immune microenvironment provided a promising avenue for personalized breast cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Abstract The Fanconi anemia (FA) repair pathway governs repair of highly genotoxic DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and relies on translesion synthesis (TLS). TLS is facilitated by REV1 or site-specific monoubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (PCNA-Ub) at lysine 164 (K164). A PcnaK164R/K164R but not Rev1−/− mutation renders mammals hypersensitive to ICLs. Besides the FA pathway, alternative pathways have been associated with ICL repair (1, 2), though the decision making between those remains elusive. To study the dependence and relevance of PCNA-Ub in FA repair, we intercrossed PcnaK164R/+; Fancg−/+ mice. A combined mutation (PcnaK164R/K164R; Fancg−/−) was found embryonically lethal. RNA-seq of primary double-mutant (DM) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) revealed elevated levels of replication stress-induced checkpoints. To exclude stress-induced confounders, we utilized a Trp53 knock-down to obtain a model to study ICL repair in depth. Regarding ICL-induced cell toxicity, cell cycle arrest, and replication fork progression, single-mutant and DM MEFs were found equally sensitive, establishing PCNA-Ub to be critical for FA-ICL repair. Immunoprecipitation and spectrometry-based analysis revealed an unknown role of PCNA-Ub in excluding mismatch recognition complex MSH2/MSH6 from being recruited to ICLs. In conclusion, our results uncovered a dual function of PCNA-Ub in ICL repair, i.e. exclude MSH2/MSH6 recruitment to channel the ICL toward canonical FA repair, in addition to its established role in coordinating TLS opposite the unhooked ICL.">

        <tr id="CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized genome engineering by allowing precise introductions of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, genome engineering in bacteria is still a complex, multi-step process requiring a donor DNA template for homology-directed repair of DSBs. Prime editing circumvents this need as the repair template is provided within the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA). Here, we developed make-or-break Prime Editing (mbPE) that allows for precise and effective genetic engineering in the opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. In contrast to traditional prime editing in which a nicking Cas9 is employed, mbPE harnesses wild type Cas9 in combination with a pegRNA that destroys the seed region or protospacer adjacent motif. Since most bacteria poorly perform template-independent end joining, correctly genome-edited clones are selectively enriched during mbPE. We show that mbPE can be used to introduce point mutations, deletions and targeted insertions, including protein tags such as a split luciferase, at selection efficiencies of over 93%. mbPE enables sequential genome editing, is scalable, and can be used to generate pools of mutants in a high-throughput manner. The mbPE system and pegRNA design guidelines described here will ameliorate future bacterial genome editing endeavors.">

Targeting of reporter genes revealed extended interference in P. oleovorans and Escherichia coli cells producing recombinant CRISPR ribonucleoprotein (crRNP) complexes. RNA-Seq analyses of Type IV-A1 CRISPRi-induced transcriptome alterations demonstrated highly effective long-range down-regulation of histidine operon expression, whereas CRISPRi effects of dCas9 remained limited to the vicinity of its binding site. Single-molecule microscopy uncovered the localization dynamics of crRNP complexes. The tracks of fluorescently labeled crRNPs co-localized with regions of increased plasmid replication, supporting efficient plasmid targeting. These results identify mechanistic principles that facilitate the application of Type IV-A1 CRISPRi for the regulation of gene expression and plasmid replication.">

The resulting uracils can be directly replicated, resulting in C to T mutations, or uracil-DNA glycosylase can convert the uracils to abasic (AP) sites which are then fixed as C to T or C to G mutations by translesion DNA polymerases. We noticed that in yeast and in human cancers, contributions of C to T and C to G mutations depends on the origin of ssDNA mutagenized by APOBECs. Since ssDNA in eukaryotic genomes readily binds to replication protein A (RPA) we asked if RPA could affect APOBEC-induced mutation spectrum in yeast. For that purpose, we expressed human APOBECs in the wild-type yeast and in strains carrying a hypomorph mutation rfa1-t33 in the large RPA subunit. We confirmed that the rfa1-t33 allele can facilitate mutagenesis by APOBECs. We also found that the rfa1-t33 mutation changed the ratio of APOBEC3A-induced T to C and T to G mutations in replicating yeast to resemble a ratio observed in long-persistent ssDNA in yeast and in cancers. We present the data suggesting that RPA may shield APOBEC formed uracils in ssDNA from Ung1, thereby facilitating C to T mutagenesis through the accurate copying of uracils by replicative DNA polymerases. Unexpectedly, we also found that for uracils shielded from Ung1 by wild-type RPA the mutagenic outcome is reduced in the presence of translesion DNA polymerase zeta.">

        <tr id="Introduction Glioblastomas utilize malignant gene expression pathways to drive growth. Many of these gene pathways are not directly accessible with molecularly targeted pharmacological agents. Chromatin-modifying compounds can alter gene expression and target glioblastoma growth pathways. In this study, we utilize a systematic screen of chromatin-modifying compounds on a panel of patient-derived glioblastoma lines to identify promising compounds and their associated gene targets. Methods Five glioblastoma cell lines were subjected to a drug screen of 106 chromatin-modifying compounds representing 36 unique drug classes to determine the twelve most promising drug classes and the best candidate inhibitors in each class. These twelve drugs were then tested with a panel of twelve patient-derived gliomasphere lines to identify growth inhibition and corresponding gene expression patterns. Overlap analysis and weighted co-expression network analysis (WCGNA) were utilized to determine potential target genes and gene pathways. Results The initial drug screen identified twelve candidate pharmacologic agents for further testing. Drug sensitivity testing indicated an overall high degree of variability between gliomasphere lines. However, CPI203 was the most consistently effective compound, and the BET inhibitor class was the most consistently effective class of compounds across the gliomasphere panel. Correspondingly, most of the compounds tested had highly variable effects on gene expression between gliomasphere lines. CPI203 stood out as the only compound to induce a consistent effect on gene expression across different gliomasphere lines, specifically down-regulation of DNA-synthesis genes. Amongst the twelve tested cell lines, high expression of CDKN2A and CDKN2B distinguished more drug sensitive from more drug resistant lines. WCGNA identified two oncogenic gene modules (FBXO5 and MELK) that were effectively downregulated by CPI203 (FBXO5) and ML228 (FBXO5 and MELK). Conclusions The bromodomain inhibitor CPI203 induced relatively consistent effects on gene expression and growth across a variety of glioblastoma lines, specifically down-regulating genes associated with DNA replication. We propose that clinically effective BET inhibitors have the potential to induce consistent beneficial effects across a spectrum of glioblastomas.">

        <tr id="Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is essential for various DNA-templated processes in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. However, comprehensive characterizations of ssDNA still lag in plants compared to non-plant systems. Here, we conducted in situ S1-seq (ISS1-seq), with starting gDNA ranging from 5 µg to 250 ng, followed by comprehensive characterizations of ssDNA in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We found that ssDNA loci were substantially associated with a subset of non-B DNA structures and functional genomic loci. Subtypes of ssDNA loci had distinct epigenetic features. Importantly, ssDNA may act alone or partly coordinate with non-B DNA structures, functional genomic loci, or epigenetic marks to actively or repressively modulate gene transcription, which is genomic-region-dependent and associated with the distinct accumulation of RNA Pol II. Moreover, distinct types of ssDNA had differential impacts on the activities and evolution of TEs (especially common or conserved TEs) in the rice genome. Our study showcases an antibody-independent technique for characterizing non-B DNA structures or functional genomic loci in plants. It lays the groundwork and fills a crucial gap for further exploration of ssDNA, non-B DNA structures, or functional genomic loci, thereby advancing our understanding of their biology in plants.">

 What’s the pattern of genome-wide chromatin occupancy of SCP3 during meiotic prophase, and how its interaction with chromatin is regulated?



 We document SCP3 enriched at active chromatin regions with largely inherited from leptotene to pachytene stage, which facilitated by transcription and condensate assembly in spermatocytes.



 Meiosis is a critical step during the process of gametogenesis to form haploid cells which finally develop into functional gametes. The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a meiosis-specific protein assembly which bridges homologous chromosomes to establish the architecture of meiotic chromosome. Genetic ablation of genes encoding SC components impedes meiosis and gametogenesis in mice and mutation of these genes is frequently found in infertile patients. SCP3 localization changes with chromosome morphology in autosomes and is involved in maintaining the association of sex chromosomes. Male mice with null mutation of SCP3 failed to form SCs, resulting in developmental arrest during meiotic prophase.



 This study included male mice at post-natal day 10 (P10), 4 weeks or adult (8 weeks or older) were maintained on C57BL/6J background. Spermatocytes were performed modified CUT&Tag using antibodies. ChIP-seq data was analyzed together with WGBS and ATAC-seq data.



 Spermatocytes were obtained by a discontinuous BSA density gradient. Cell pellet was resuspended in culture medium (MEM with 10% FBS) at a concentration of 105 cells/ml and cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Spermatocytes were cultured with or without 1,6-hexanediol or α-amanitin. Spermatocytes with or without drug treatment were collected at indicated time points for further examination and then modified CUT&Tag and co-IP using anti-SCP3 and anti-POL II antibodies.



 Chromatin occupancy of SCP3 in leptotene and pachytene spermatocytes, SCP3-Core sites retained upon treatment of 1,6-hexanediol which dissolves SCP3 condensate, and SCP1 occupancy at meiotic chromatin in pachytene spermatocytes. When we determined inter-peak distances and width of peaks, we observe that: (1) SCP3 occupancy in leptotene stage had greater inter-peak distances and narrower peak width than SCP3 occupancy in pachytene stage, demonstrating gradual accumulated SCP3 at chromatin during meiotic progression; (2) SCP3-Core sites have broader peak width than SCP3-NonCore sites, in agreement with stability of SCP3 occupancy at SCP3-Core sites; (3) SCP1 occupancy had greater inter-peak distances and narrower peak width than SCP3 occupancy in pachytene stage, supporting that SCP1 peaks are a subset of SCP3 peaks and SCP1’s major function in connecting LE and CE respectively. Generally, at pachytene-stage meiosis, SCP3 mainly occupies chromatin regions including transcriptionally active sites, Deu and Alu elements, while SCP1 mainly co-localizes with SCP3 at a subset of regions with open chromatin and high cohesin enrichment to connect meiotic chromosome axes with CE. In this way, a local active chromatin environment is created at meiotic chromosome axes, facilitating homologous chromosome recombination.



 Our test was not successful to examine SCP3 occupancy with as few as less than 1000 spermatocytes using our protocol. It is improvement of efficiency of tagmentation or development of more efficient antibodies against SCP3 will be helpful for clinical sample detection.



 SCP3 occupancy was largely inherited from leptotene to pachytene stage, facilitated by transcription and condensate assembly, and enriched at specific SINE repeats. Further exploration using knockout mouse models of meiotic axial proteins and epigenetic modifiers will provide valuable information on meiotic chromatin architecture and crosstalk among meiotic chromatin events.

        <tr id="Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease, in which a number of genetic and epigenetic changes occur in tumor onset and progression. Recent studies indicate that changes at the RNA level are also involved in tumorigenesis, such as adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing. Here, we systematically investigate transcriptome-wide A-to-I editing events in a large number of samples from Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). Using a computational pipeline that determines significant differences in editing level between NHL and normal samples at known A-to-I editing sites, we identify a number of differentially edited editing sites between NHL subtypes and normal samples. Most of the differentially edited sites are located in non-coding regions, and many such sites show a strong correlation between gene expression level and editing efficiency, indicating that RNA editing might have direct consequences for the cancer cell’s aberrant gene regulation status in these cases. Moreover, we establish a strong link between RNA editing and NHL by demonstrating that NHL and normal samples and even NHL subtypes can be distinguished based on genome-wide RNA editing profiles alone. Our study establishes a strong link between RNA editing, cancer and aberrant gene regulation in NHL.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT This research investigates the intricate dynamics of DNA methylation in the hours following CD8+ T cell activation, during a critical yet understudied temporal window. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification central to regulation of gene expression and directing immune responses. Our investigation spanned 96-h post-activation and unveils a nuanced tapestry of global and site-specific methylation changes. We identified 15,626 significant differentially methylated CpGs spread across the genome, with the most significant changes occurring within the genes ADAM10, ICA1, and LAPTM5. While many changes had modest effect sizes, approximately 120 CpGs exhibited a log2FC above 1.5, with cell activation and proliferation pathways the most affected. Relatively few of the differentially methylated CpGs occurred along adjacent gene regions. The exceptions were seven differentially methylated gene regions, with the Human T cell Receptor Alpha Joining Genes demonstrating consistent methylation change over a 3kb window. We also investigated whether an inflammatory environment could alter DNA methylation during activation, with proliferating cells exposed to the oxidant glycine chloramine. No substantial differential methylation was observed in this context. The temporal perspective of early activation adds depth to the evolving field of epigenetic immunology, offering insights with implications for therapeutic innovation and expanding our understanding of epigenetic modulation in immune function.">

        <tr id="Maintenance of genome stability is of paramount importance for the survival of an organism. However, genomic integrity is constantly being challenged by various endogenous and exogenous processes that damage DNA. Therefore, cells are heavily reliant on DNA repair pathways that have evolved to deal with every type of genotoxic insult that threatens to compromise genome stability. Notably, inherited mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in these protective pathways trigger the onset of disease that is driven by chromosome instability e.g. neurodevelopmental abnormalities, neurodegeneration, premature ageing, immunodeficiency and cancer development. The ability of cells to regulate the recruitment of specific DNA repair proteins to sites of DNA damage is extremely complex but is primarily mediated by protein post-translational modifications (PTMs). Ubiquitylation is one such PTM, which controls genome stability by regulating protein localisation, protein turnover, protein-protein interactions and intra-cellular signalling. Over the past two decades, numerous ubiquitin (Ub) E3 ligases have been identified to play a crucial role not only in the initiation of DNA replication and DNA damage repair but also in the efficient termination of these processes. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of how different Ub E3 ligases (RNF168, TRAIP, HUWE1, TRIP12, FANCL, BRCA1, RFWD3) function to regulate DNA repair and replication and the pathological consequences arising from inheriting deleterious mutations that compromise the Ub-dependent DNA damage response.">

        <tr id="Precise DNA replication is fundamental for genetic inheritance. In eukaryotes, replication initiates at multiple origins that are first "licensed" and subsequently "fired" to activate DNA synthesis. Despite the success in identifying origins with specific DNA motifs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, no consensus sequence or sequences with a predictive value of replication origins have been recognized in metazoan genomes. Rather, epigenetic rules and chromatin structures are believed to play important roles in governing the selection and activation of replication origins. We propose that replication initiation is facilitated by a group of sequence-specific "replication pioneer factors," which function to increase chromatin accessibility and foster a chromatin environment that is conducive to the loading of the prereplication complex. Dysregulation of the function of these factors may lead to gene duplication, genomic instability, and ultimately the occurrence of pathological conditions such as cancer.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) stands as one of the most prevalent and aggressive forms of renal malignancies, accounting for a substantial portion of kidney cancer-related mortality worldwide. The heterogeneity within ccRCC poses a significant challenge to understanding its molecular mechanisms and devising effective therapeutic strategies. [1] Previous studies utilizing single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) have revealed transcriptional contributions to cell-type specificity in both mature human and mouse kidneys. Moreover, recent advancements have expanded this approach to single-cell profiling of chromatin accessibility. Single-nuclei assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq) has enabled the measurement of chromatin accessibility in thousands of individual cells, providing insights into the dynamic process that drives nephron development and differentiation. Integration and analysis of multimodal single-cell datasets, such as snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq, allows for the prediction of cell-type-specific cis-regulatory DNA interactions and transcription factor activity, complementing the transcriptional information obtained by snRNA-seq.[2] [3] [1] Yang, Wang, and Yang, “Treatment Strategies for Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.” [2] Muto et al., “Single Cell Transcriptional and Chromatin Accessibility Profiling Redefine Cellular Heterogeneity in the Adult Human Kidney.” [3] Monteagudo-Sánchez, Noordermeer, and Greenberg, “The Impact of DNA Methylation on CTCF-Mediated 3D Genome Organization.” Methods This study leveraged paired snRNA/ATAC-seq in tumor and normal-adjacent samples from the Renal Tumor Biobank at Dartmouth (n= 63) to explore the ccRCC landscape at single-cell resolution using 10x multiome technology. The snRNA-seq dataset was processed with Seurat v5.0 to remove low-quality nuclei. Doublets were removed with DoubletFinder v2.02, and ambient DNA was removed using decontX from celda. Normalization was conducted via SCTransform, and missing data was imputed with ALRA. Clustering was performed by constructing a KNN graph and running the Louvain algorithm. Cell type assignments were predicted using Azimuth with the human kidney reference dataset. The snATAC-seq data was processed with ArchR v1.0.1, which performed dimensionality reduction and clustering. Cluster identities defined in the Seurat workflow were cross-annotated to the ATAT-seq data, and open peaks were identified within these cell-type clusters using MACS3 v3.0.1. Identification of marker peaks, motif enrichment, and motif enrichment deviations were inferred utilizing ArchR’s getmarkerFeatures, peakAnnoEnrichment, and addMotifAnnotations functions, respectively. Results Motif enrichment analysis revealed canonical cancer-associated transcription factor (TF) dysregulation in tumor cells (nephron loop-like), including enrichment of HNF1B, SMARCC1, FOSL1, and JUND. Interestingly, HNF and SMARCC were also enriched in the lymphoid compartment, indicating possible crosstalk between these two cell types. Previous work has investigated the involvement of the HNF1 in ccRCC and in chromophobe RCC for prognosis,and we plan on investigating the relationship of these enrichments to tumor grade, stage and outcome.[1] Additional TF enrichments included BCL families and ELF within the myeloid compartment, and vascularization related TF families in endothelial cell types including enrichment of various ETS TFs. Investigation of cell-cell interactions between immune and endothelial cell populations as well as between tumor and normal adjacent tissues will be performed to further disentangle the role differentially accessable chromatin plays in ccRCC. [1] Buchner et al., “Downregulation of HNF-1B in Renal Cell Carcinoma Is Associated With Tumor Progression and Poor Prognosis.” Conclusions Our multi-omic approach has several advantages. First, it enables the characterization of cellular heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment, identifying cell populations and their contributions to disease progression. Secondly, by integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic data, we gain insights into the dynamic interplay between gene expression and chromatin accessibility, uncovering potential therapeutic vulnerabilities and biomarkers for personalized treatment strategies.

Consequently, biomarkers facilitating early diagnosis of LUSC could significantly enhance patient survival. This study aims to identify novel biomarkers for LUSC. Methods Utilizing the TCGA, GTEx, and CGGA databases, we focused on the gene encoding Family with Sequence Similarity 20, Member A (FAM20A) across various cancers. We then corroborated these bioinformatic predictions with clinical samples. A range of analytical tools, including Kaplan-Meier, MethSurv database, Wilcoxon rank-sum, Kruskal-Wallis tests, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and TIMER database, were employed to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of FAM20A in LUSC. These tools also helped evaluate immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint genes, DNA repair-related genes, DNA methylation, and tumor-related pathways. Results FAM20A expression was found to be significantly reduced in LUSC, correlating with lower survival rates. It exhibited a negative correlation with key proteins in DNA repair signaling pathways, potentially contributing to LUSC’s radiotherapy resistance. Additionally, FAM20A showed a positive correlation with immune checkpoints like CTLA-4, indicating potential heightened sensitivity to immunotherapies targeting these checkpoints.

Nonetheless, studying the role of specific gene methylation events in fish faces challenges. In this study, we validate the regulation of DNA methylation on empty spiracles homeobox 2 (emx2) expression with decitabine treatment in Chinese tongue sole testis cells. We used the emx2 gene as the target gene and developed a new DNA methylation editing system by fusing dnmt3a with catalytic dead Cas9 (dCas9) and demonstrated its ability for sequence-specific DNA methylation editing. Results revealed that utilizing dCas9-dnmt3a to target emx2 promoter region led to increased DNA methylation levels and decreased emx2 expression in Chinese tongue sole testis cells. More importantly, the DNA methylation editing significantly suppressed the expression of MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor (myc), one target gene of emx2. Furthermore, we assessed the off-target effects of dCas9-dnmt3a and confirmed no significant impact on the predicted off-target gene expression. Taken together, we developed the first DNA methylation editing system in marine species and demonstrated its effective editing ability in Chinese tongue sole cells.

During subculture expansion, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) senescence diminishes their multi-differentiation capabilities, leading to a loss of therapeutic potential. Up to date, the extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) have been demonstrated to be involved in senescence but the roles of eccDNAs during MSC.Here we explored eccDNA profiles in human bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs). EccDNA and mRNA was purified and sequenced, followed by quantification and functional annotation. Moreover, we mapped our datasets with the downloading enhancer and transcription factor-regulated genes to explore the potential role of eccDNAs.Sequentially, gene annotation analysis revealed that the majority of eccDNA were mapped in the intron regions with limited BM-MSC enhancer overlaps. We discovered that these eccDNA motifs in senescent BMSCs acted as motifs for binding transcription factors (TFs) of senescence-related genes.These findings are highly significant for identifying biomarkers of senescence and therapeutic targets in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for future clinical applications. The potential of eccDNA as a stable therapeutic target for senescence-related disorders warrants further investigation, particularly exploring chemically synthesized eccDNAs as transcription factor regulatory elements to reverse cellular senescence.">

        <tr id="Tumor protein p53 (TP53) mediates DNA repair and cell proliferation in growing cells. The TP53 gene is a tumor suppressor that regulates the expression of target genes in response to multiple cellular stress factors. Key target genes are involved in crucial cellular events such as DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, metabolism, and senescence. TP53 genetic variants and the activity of the wild-type p53 protein (WT-p53) have been linked to a wide range of tumorigenesis. Various genetic and epigenetic alterations, including germline and somatic mutations, loss of heterozygosity, and DNA methylation, can alter TP53 activity, potentially resulting in cancer initiation and progression. This study was designed to screen three reported mutations in the DNA-binding domain of the p53 protein in breast cancer, to evaluate the relative susceptibility and risk associated with breast cancer in the local population. Genomic DNA was isolated from 30 breast tumor tissues along with controls. Tetra and Tri ARMS PCR were performed to detect mutations in the TP53 coding region. For SNPs c.637C>T and c.733C>T, all analyzed cases were homozygous for the wild-type allele ‘C,’ while for SNP c.745A>G, all cases were homozygous for the wild-type allele ‘A.’ These results indicate no relevance of these three SNPs to cancer progression in our study cohort. Additionally, the findings from whole exon sequencing will help to predict more precise outcomes and assess the importance of TP53 gene mutations in breast cancer patients.">

        <tr id="There remains a large need for a greater understanding of the metastatic process within the prostate cancer field. Our research aims to understand the adaptive – ergo potentially metastatic – responses of cancer to changing microenvironments. Emerging evidence has implicated a role of the Polyaneuploid Cancer Cell (PACC) state in metastasis, positing the PACC state as capable of conferring metastatic competency. Mounting in vitro evidence supports increased metastatic potential of cells in the PACC state. Additionally, our recent retrospective study of prostate cancer patients revealed that PACC presence in the prostate at the time of radical prostatectomy was predictive of future metastatic progression. To test for a causative relationship between PACC state biology and metastasis, we leveraged a novel method designed for flow-cytometric detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in subcutaneous, caudal artery, and intracardiac mouse models of metastasis. This approach provides both quantitative and qualitative information about the number and PACC-status of recovered CTCs and DTCs. Collating data from all models, we found that 74% of recovered CTCs and DTCs were in the PACC state. In vivo colonization assays proved PACC populations can regain proliferative capacity at metastatic sites following dormancy. Additional direct and indirect mechanistic in vitro analyses revealed a PACC-specific partial Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal-Transition phenotype and a pro-metastatic secretory profile, together providing preliminary evidence that PACCs are mechanistically linked to metastasis. Statement of Significance We provide the first evidence that cells in the polyaneuploid cancer cell state contribute to increased metastatic competency in vivo.">

However, little attempt has been made to interpret k-mers in the context of genome rearrangements, partly due to challenges in the exhaustive and high-throughput identification of genome structure and individual rearrangement events. Here, we present GWarrange, a pre- and post-bGWAS processing methodology that leverages the unique properties of k-mers to facilitate bGWAS for genome rearrangements. Repeat sequences are common instigators of genome rearrangements through intragenomic homologous recombination, and they are commonly found at rearrangement boundaries. Using whole-genome sequences, repeat sequences are replaced by short placeholder sequences, allowing the regions flanking repeats to be incorporated into relatively short k-mers. Then, locations of flanking regions in significant k-mers are mapped back to complete genome sequences to visualise genome rearrangements. Four case studies based on two bacterial species (Bordetella pertussis and Enterococcus faecium) and a simulated genome set are presented to demonstrate the ability to identify phenotype-associated rearrangements.

        <tr id="Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a widely used method for classifying cell types and states and revealing disease mechanisms. However, most contemporary scRNA-seq platforms fail to explore the multi-landscape of RNA. Here, we designed a microfluidic chip combined oligo-dT primers and Random Bridging Co-labeling (RBCL) RNA sequencing to develop an innovative Chigene scRNA-seq technology that can identify gene expression, mutations, and RNA splicing landscapes at the single-cell level. The Chigene scRNA-seq platform demonstrated exceptional performance, with minimal doublet rates of 0.94% (Chigene V1) and 1.93% (Chigene V2). Both versions exhibit high sensitivity, with Chigene V2 achieving nearly 100% RNA coverage and detecting over 1800 genes per cell on average. Targeted capture of single-cell gene mutations enhances mutation detection sensitivity. Moreover, this Chigene V2 platform has been validated in clinical samples for its ability to detect mutations, gene fusions and alternative splicing. The reliability of the platform was further corroborated using known functional gene mutation (CDKN1A) and fusion (FGFR3-TACC). To validate this method’s potential for discovering novel gene mutations in clinical samples, our investigation revealed an intriguing cell subpopulation carrying an ARHGAP5 mutation in urothelial carcinoma. These cells exhibited high-frequency mRNA splicing and exhibited specific crosstalk with T cells, distinguishing them from the subpopulation with the ARHGAP5 wild-type phenotype. Overall, this method provides a robust scRNA-seq platform suitable for comprehensive analyses of clinical specimens at different genetic information levels, thereby offering significant potential in the discovery of novel genes and interactions at the single-cell level.">

Elucidation of the epigenetic underpinnings of these subtypes could provide important insights into the drivers of therapy resistance. In this study, we produced chromatin accessibility maps linked to the binding of lineage-specific transcription factors (TF) by performing ATAC sequencing on 70 mCRPC tissue biopsies integrated with transcriptome and whole genome sequencing. mCRPC had a distinct global chromatin accessibility profile linked to AR function. Analysis of TF occupancy across accessible chromatin revealed 203 TFs associated with mCRPC subtypes. Notably, ZNF263 was identified as a putative prostate cancer TF with a significant impact on gene activity in the double-negative (AR- neuroendocrine-) subtype, potentially activating MYC targets. Overall, this analysis of chromatin accessibility in mCRPC provides valuable insights into epigenetic changes that occur during progression to mCRPC.">

As drivers in pediatric brain tumors, and in several other types of cancers, oncohistones brought a “new dimension of Strange” into the cancer multiverse, to paraphrase Marvel. An integrative approach to cancer complexity as a multidimensional projection is urgently needed to consider all relevant etiological, developmental, and evolutionary components. Here, we discuss recent progress on histone variants and chaperones, their regulation and alterations in cancers, the available in vivo models, and current treatment strategies. More specifically, we adopt a view through the lens of tissue-specific differences and means for genome expression and integrity maintenance.">

        <tr id="MYC has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide range of human tumors and has been described for many years as a transcription factor that regulates genes with pleiotropic functions to promote tumorigenic growth. However, despite extensive efforts to identify specific target genes of MYC that alone could be responsible for promoting tumorigenesis, the field is yet to reach a consensus whether this is the crucial function of MYC. Recent work shifts the view on MYC's function from being a gene-specific transcription factor to an essential stress resilience factor. In highly proliferating cells, MYC preserves cell integrity by promoting DNA repair at core promoters, protecting stalled replication forks, and/or preventing transcription-replication conflicts. Furthermore, an increasing body of evidence demonstrates that MYC not only promotes tumorigenesis by driving cell-autonomous growth, but also enables tumors to evade the host's immune system. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of how MYC impairs antitumor immunity and why this function is evolutionarily hard-wired to the biology of the MYC protein family. We show why the cell-autonomous and immune evasive functions of MYC are mutually dependent and discuss ways to target MYC proteins in cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
Sarcoma encompasses a diverse group of cancers that are typically resistant to current therapies, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The contexture of sarcomas limits generation of high-quality data using cutting-edge molecular profiling methods, such as single-cell RNA-seq, thus hampering progress in understanding these understudied cancers.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Here, we demonstrate feasibility of producing multi-modal single-cell genomics and whole-genome sequencing data from frozen tissues, profiling 75,716 cell transcriptomes of five undifferentiated pleomorphic (UPS) and three intimal sarcomas (INS) samples, including paired specimens from two patients treated with ICB.


RESULTS
We find that genomic diversity decreases in patients with response to ICB, and, in unbiased analyses, identify cancer cell programs associated with therapy resistance. Although interactions of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes within the tumor ecosystem increase in ICB responders, clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells alone was insufficient to predict drug responses.


CONCLUSION
This study provides a framework for studying rare tumors and identifies salient and treatment-associated cancer cell intrinsic and tumor-microenvironmental features in sarcomas.">

CRISPR-Cas9, -Cas12 and related proteins use guide RNAs to recognize ∼20-nucleotide target sites within genomic DNA by mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. We used structural and biochemical methods to assess early steps in DNA recognition by Cas12a protein-guide RNA complexes. We show here that Cas12a initiates DNA target recognition by bending DNA to induce transient nucleotide flipping that exposes nucleobases for DNA-RNA hybridization. Cryo-EM structural analysis of a trapped Cas12a-RNA-DNA surveillance complex and fluorescence-based conformational probing show that Cas12a-induced DNA helix destabilization enables target discovery and engagement. This mechanism of initial DNA interrogation resembles that of CRISPR-Cas9 despite distinct evolutionary origins and different RNA-DNA hybridization directionality of these enzyme families. Our findings support a model in which RNA-mediated DNA engineering begins with local helix distortion by transient CRISPR-Cas protein binding.">

Inactivating Pms2, the human homologue of yeast Pms1, increases the chances of colorectal and uterine cancers. Here we use whole genome sequencing to show that loss of this endonuclease activity, via the pms1-DE variant, results in strong mutator effects throughout the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Mutation rates are strongly increased for mutations resulting from all types of single-base substitutions and for a wide variety of single- and multi-base indel mutations. Rates for these events are further increased in strains combining pms1-DE with mutator variants of each of the three major leading and lagging strand replicases. In all cases, mutation rates, spectra, biases, and context preferences are statistically indistinguishable from strains with equivalent polymerases but lacking initial mismatch recognition due to deletion of MSH2. This implies that, across the nuclear genome, strand discrimination via the Pms1 endonuclease is as important for MMR as is initial mismatch recognition by Msh2 heterodimers.">

        <tr id="Radiation cytogenetics has a rich history seldom appreciated by those outside the field. Early radiobiology was dominated by physics and biophysical concepts that borrowed heavily from the study of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations. From such studies, quantitative relationships between biological effect and changes in absorbed dose, dose rate and ionization density were codified into key concepts of radiobiological theory that have persisted for nearly a century. This review aims to provide a historical perspective of some of these concepts, including evidence supporting the contention that chromosome aberrations underlie development of many, if not most, of the biological effects of concern for humans exposed to ionizing radiations including cancer induction, on the one hand, and tumor eradication on the other. The significance of discoveries originating from these studies has widened and extended far beyond their original scope. Chromosome structural rearrangements viewed in mitotic cells were first attributed to the production of breaks by the radiations during interphase, followed by the rejoining or mis-rejoining among ends of other nearby breaks. These relatively modest beginnings eventually led to the discovery and characterization of DNA repair of double-strand breaks by non-homologous end joining, whose importance to various biological processes is now widely appreciated. Two examples, among many, are V(D)J recombination and speciation. Rapid technological advancements in cytogenetics, the burgeoning fields of molecular radiobiology and third-generation sequencing served as a point of confluence between the old and new. As a result, the emergent field of "cytogenomics" now becomes uniquely positioned for the purpose of more fully understanding mechanisms underlying the biological effects of ionizing radiation exposure.">

        <tr id="Endometrial cancer (EC) is a devastating and common disease affecting women’s health. The NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program predicted that there would be >66,000 new cases in the United States and >13,000 deaths from EC in 2023, and EC is the sixth most common cancer among women worldwide. Regulation of mitochondrial metabolism plays a role in tumorigenesis. In proliferating cancer cells, mitochondria provide the necessary building blocks for biosynthesis of amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, and glucose. One mechanism causing altered mitochondrial activity is mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation. The polyploid human mtDNA genome is a circular double-stranded molecule essential to vertebrate life that harbors genes critical for oxidative phosphorylation plus mitochondrial-derived peptide genes. Cancer cells display aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, which arises from the needs of fast-dividing cells and is characterized by increased glucose uptake and conversion of glucose to lactate. Solid tumors often contain at least one mtDNA substitution. Furthermore, it is common for cancer cells to harbor mixtures of wild-type and mutant mtDNA genotypes, known as heteroplasmy. Considering the increase in cancer cell energy demand, the presence of functionally relevant carcinogenesis-inducing or environment-adapting mtDNA mutations in cancer seems plausible. We review 279 EC tumor-specific mtDNA single nucleotide variants from 111 individuals from different studies. Many transition mutations indicative of error-prone DNA polymerase γ replication and C to U deamination events were present. We examine the spectrum of mutations and their heteroplasmy and discuss the potential biological impact of recurrent, non-synonymous, insertion, and deletion mutations. Lastly, we explore current EC treatments, exploiting cancer cell mitochondria for therapy and the prospect of using mtDNA variants as an EC biomarker.">

Furthermore, Pol II readthrough defects and increased TERRA correlate with increased differentiation of promastigotes to the infectious metacyclic life stage and decreased cell viability.

Here, we report the design and optimization of a simple and efficient reporter-based assay to visualize and quantify HDR efficiency. Through random screening of a small molecule compound library, two groups of compounds, including the topoisomerase inhibitors and PIM1 kinase inhibitors, have been identified to promote HDR.

        <tr id="Motivation By accounting for variants within measured transcripts, it is possible to evaluate the status of somatic variants using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and to characterize their clonality. However, the sparsity (very few reads per transcript) or bias in protocols (favoring 3’ ends of the transcripts) makes the chance of capturing somatic variants very unlikely. This can be overcome by targeted sequencing or the use of mitochondrial variants as natural barcodes for clone identification. Currently, available computational tools focus on genotyping, but do not provide functionality for combined analysis of somatic and mitochondrial variants and functional analysis such as characterization of gene expression changes in detected clones. Results Here, we propose SIGURD, which is an R-based pipeline for the clonal analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. This allows the quantification of clones by leveraging both somatic and mitochondrial variants. SIGURD also allows for functional analysis after clonal detection: association of clones with cell populations, detection of differentially expressed genes across clones and association of somatic and mitochondrial variants. Here, we demonstrate the power of SIGURD by analyzing single-cell data of colony-forming cells derived from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.

The DNA damage repair (DDR) protein topoisomerase I (TOP1) has been linked to various cancers, yet its distinct roles and mechanisms in CC are not fully elucidated.Methods: We investigated TOP1 expression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and CC tissues utilizing qRT-PCR and IHC, correlating findings with patient prognosis. Subsequent knockdown studies were performed in vitro and in vivo to evaluate the influence of TOP1 on tumor growth, DNA repair, and inflammatory responses.Results: TOP1 was highly expressed in CIN and CC, negatively correlating with patient prognosis. Inhibition of TOP1 impeded CC cell growth and disrupted DNA repair. TOP1 was shown to regulate tumor-promoting inflammation and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) production in a cGAS-dependent manner. HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 upregulated TOP1 and activated the cGAS-PD-L1 pathway.Conclusions: TOP1 acts as a DNA repair mediator, promoting CC development and immune evasion. Targeting the TOP1-cGAS-PD-L1 axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for CC.">

One such pair in an epigenetically quiescent region showed different impacts on gene expression, chromatin accessibility and chromatin organization. We also found that deleting the essential hub altered the genetic network activity and increased the entropy of chromatin accessibility, more severe than that caused by deletion of the nonessential hub, suggesting that they are critical for maintaining an ordered chromatin structure.

 What is the cause of loss of heterozygosity, frequently observed in embryos subjected to CRISPR-Cas9, an interhomolog-homologous recombination repair (IH-HR) or deficiency in DNA repair?



 Vast majority of LOH observed in human zygotes subjected to CRISPR-based editing is explained by deficiency in DNA repair prior to genome activation, not IH-HR.



 Genome editing (GE) at the preimplantation stage, intended to correct disease-causing mutations, is controversial due to safety and ethical concerns. It has been suggested that a high frequency of LOH seen in zygotes subjected to GE could be explained by resolution of the double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) created using CRISPR-Cas9 by interhomolog-homologous recombination repair (IH-HR), a process with potential to correct deleterious heterozygous mutations. However, such hypotheses are controversial and it is unclear whether embryos at this stage development can utilise IH-HR. CRISPR-Cas9 targeted sites are difficult to interrogate with traditional methods, risking a misinterpretation of editing outcomes.



 We hypothesised that the frequently observed LOH affecting the CRISPR-targeted sites in human zygotes is caused by the deficiency in DNA repair at this developmental stage, resulting in complex genotypes which traditional molecular methods have failed to detect, and not IH-HR which uses the second un-cleaved parental allele as a template for repair. DSBs were induced at three genomic sites in embryos microinjected at the time of fertilisation (n = 27) in this IRB-approved study.



 Research embryos were cultured for 60 hours, then disaggregated. Individual cells underwent an array of genetic tests, including NGS, allowing determination of the repair pathway utilised and revealing any cytogenetic abnormalities. A novel state-of-the-art analytical workflow was developed to interrogate 25kb around CRISPR cleavage sites. This approach provided a means of detecting complex genomic rearrangements as well as unresolved DNA damage, which would appear as LOH when employing traditional PCR-based approaches for assessment.



 Induction of DSBs using CRISPR-Cas9 was 100% efficient when applied at the time of fertilisation. LOH was confirmed to be common at targeted sites, affecting 69/216 (32%) loci examined in 108 blastomeres. Remarkably, the great majority of LOH events (>90%) were a direct consequence of inappropriate/failed DNA repair (unresolved DNA breaks or complex genomic rearrangements). Strikingly, not a single instance of IH-HR was observed when CRISPR reagents were introduced at fertilisation. This may be explained by the physical separation of the two parental genomes in distinct pronuclei at that time. Allele-drop out (ADO), a technical problem, accounted for <10% of all LOH events. In total, 46% of DSBs failed to undergo appropriate repair, resulting in segmental aneuploidy (21%), large-scale deletions (10%), inversions/translocations (10%), or loss of the targeted chromosome (5%). 45% of DSBs were resolved using error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), while only 9% utilised the homology directed repair (HDR) pathway required for correction of mutations. Application of CRISPR-Cas9 to embryos on day-3 of development (after embryonic genome activation - EGA) was less efficient, only producing a DSB in 6/37 embryos (16%). However, the mode of repair differed markedly, 100% employing HDR (p = 0.0001). In 4 cases, this involved IH-HR.



 This data provides strong evidence that LOH recorded in earlier studies was incorrectly attributed to IH-HR and was actually due to abnormal/failed repair. CRISPR appears more effective after EGA, with efficient DNA repair dominated by desirable HDR. However, a larger number of embryos is required to corroborate this finding.



 The use of CRISPR-Cas9 at the time of fertilisation is frequently associated with problematic, unintended outcomes, rendering the technique clinically inapplicable in the current format. Careful study design which allows determination of all possible editing outcomes is essential and advances our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of DNA repair.

        <tr id="During the metagenomics era, high-throughput sequencing efforts both in mice and humans indicate that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute a significant fraction of the transcribed genome. During the past decades, the regulatory role of these non-coding transcripts along with their interactions with other molecules have been extensively characterized. However, the study of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), an ncRNA regulatory class with transcript lengths that exceed 200 nucleotides, revealed that certain non-coding transcripts are transcriptional “by-products”, while their loci exert their downstream regulatory functions through RNA-independent mechanisms. Such mechanisms include, but are not limited to, chromatin interactions and complex promoter-enhancer competition schemes that involve the underlying ncRNA locus with or without its nascent transcription, mediating significant or even exclusive roles in the regulation of downstream target genes in mammals. Interestingly, such RNA-independent mechanisms often drive pathological manifestations, including oncogenesis. In this review, we summarize selective examples of lncRNAs that regulate target genes independently of their produced transcripts.">

        <tr id="The co-occurrence of chromosome 10 loss and chromosome 7 gain in gliomas is the most frequent loss-gain co-aneuploidy pair in human cancers. This phenomenon has been investigated since the late 1980s without resolution. Expanding beyond previous gene-centric studies, we investigated the co-occurrence in a genome-wide manner taking an evolutionary perspective. Mining of large-scale tumor aneuploidy data confirmed the previous finding of a small-scale longitudinal study that the most likely order is chromosome 10 loss followed by chromosome 7 gain. Extensive analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data from both patients and cell lines revealed that this co-occurrence can be explained by functional rescue interactions that are highly enriched on chromosome 7, which could potentially compensate for any detrimental consequences arising from the loss of chromosome 10. Transcriptomic data from various normal, non-cancerous human brain tissues were analyzed to assess which tissues may be most predisposed to tolerate compensation of chromosome 10 loss by chromosome 7 gain. The analysis indicated that the pre-existing transcriptomic states in the cortex and frontal cortex, where gliomas arise, are more favorable than other brain regions for compensation by rescuer genes that are active on chromosome 7. Collectively, these findings suggest that the phenomenon of chromosome 10 loss and chromosome 7 gain in gliomas is orchestrated by a complex interaction of many genes residing within these two chromosomes and provide a plausible reason why this co-occurrence happens preferentially in cancers originating in certain regions of the brain.">

        <tr id="53BP1 plays a crucial role in regulating DNA damage repair pathway choice and checkpoint signaling in somatic cells; however, its role in meiosis has remained enigmatic. In this study, we demonstrate that the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of 53BP1, HSR-9, associates with chromatin in both proliferating and meiotic germ cells. Notably, HSR-9 is enriched on the X chromosome pair in pachytene oogenic germ cells. HSR-9 is also present at kinetochores during both mitotic and meiotic divisions but does not appear to be essential for monitoring microtubule-kinetochore attachments or tension. Using cytological markers of different steps in recombinational repair, we found that HSR-9 influences the processing of a subset of meiotic double strand breaks into COSA-1-marked crossovers. Additionally, HSR-9 plays a role in meiotic X chromosome segregation under conditions where X chromosomes fail to pair, synapse, and recombine. Together, these results highlight that chromatin-associated HSR-9 has both conserved and unique functions in the regulation of meiotic chromosome behavior.">

        <tr id="Application of laser-generated electron beams in radiotherapy is a recent development. Accordingly, mechanisms of biological response to radiation damage need to be investigated. In this study, telomere length (TL) as endpoint of genetic damage was analyzed in human blood cells (leukocytes) and K562 leukemic cells irradiated with laser-generated ultrashort electron beam. Metaphases and interphases were analyzed in quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) to assess TL. TLs were shortened compared to non-irradiated controls in both settings (metaphase and interphase) after irradiation with 0.5, 1.5, and 3.0 Gy in blood leukocytes. Radiation also caused a significant TL shortening detectable in the interphase of K562 cells. Overall, a negative correlation between TL and radiation doses was observed in normal and leukemic cells in a dose-dependent manner. K562 cells were more sensitive than normal blood cells to increasing doses of ultrashort electron beam radiation. As telomere shortening leads to genome instability and cell death, the results obtained confirm the suitability of this biomarker for assessing genotoxic effects of accelerated electrons for their further use in radiation therapy. Observed differences in TL shortening between normal and K562 cells provide an opportunity for further development of optimal radiation parameters to reduce side effects in normal cells during radiotherapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have enabled the precise decoding of genomes in non-model organisms, providing a basis for unraveling the patterns and mechanisms of sex chromosome evolution. Studies of different species have yielded conflicting results regarding the traditional theory that sex chromosomes evolve from autosomes via the accumulation of deleterious mutations and degeneration of the Y (or W) chromosome. The concept of the ‘sex chromosome cycle,’ emerging from this context, posits that at any stage of the cycle (i.e., differentiation, degeneration, or loss), sex chromosome turnover can occur while maintaining stable sex determination. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that drive both the persistence and turnover of sex chromosomes at each stage of the cycle is crucial. In this review, we integrate recent findings on the mechanisms underlying maintenance and turnover, with a special focus on several organisms having unique sex chromosomes. Our review suggests that the diversity of sex chromosomes in the maintenance of stable sex determination is underappreciated and emphasizes the need for more research on the sex chromosome cycle.">

        <tr id="Somatic evolution in ageing tissues underlies many cancers. However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.">

        <tr id="Neuroblastoma (NB) is a heterogeneous childhood cancer with a slightly higher incidence in boys than girls, with the reason for this gender disparity unknown. Given the growing evidence for the involvement of loss of the Y chromosome (LoY) in male diseases including cancer, we investigated Y chromosome status in NB. Male NB tumor samples from a Swedish cohort, analyzed using Cytoscan HD SNP-microarray, were selected. Seventy NB tumors were analyzed for aneuploidy of the Y chromosome, and these data were correlated with other genetic, biological, and clinical parameters. LoY was found in 21% of the male NB tumors and it was almost exclusively found in those with high-risk genomic profiles. Furthermore, LoY was associated with increased age at diagnosis and enriched in tumors with 11q-deletion and activated telomere maintenance mechanisms. In contrast, tumors with an MYCN-amplified genomic profile retained their Y chromosome. The understanding of LoY in cancer is limited, making it difficult to conclude whether LoY is a driving event in NB or function of increased genomic instability. Gene expression analysis of Y chromosome genes in male NB tumors showed low expression of certain genes correlating with worse overall survival. KDM5D, encoding a histone demethylase stands out as an interesting candidate for further studies. LoY has been shown to impact the epigenomic layer of autosomal loci in nonreproductive tissues, and KDM5D has been reported as downregulated and/or associated with poor survival in different malignancies. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms and functional consequences of LoY in NB.">

        <tr id="Immunofluorescence with antibodies against phosphorylated forms of H2AX (γH2AX) is revolutionizing our understanding of repair and signaling of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Unfortunately, the pattern of γH2AX foci depends upon a number of parameters (nature of stress, number of foci, radiation dose, repair time, cell cycle phase, gene mutations, etc…) whose one of the common points is chromatin condensation/decondensation. Here, we endeavored to demonstrate how chromatin conformation affects γH2AX foci pattern and influences immunofluorescence signal. DSBs induced in non-transformed human fibroblasts were analyzed by γH2AX immunofluorescence with sodium butyrate treatment of chromatin applied after the irradiation that decondenses chromatin but does not induce DNA breaks. Our data showed that the pattern of γH2AX foci may drastically change with the experimental protocols in terms of size and brightness. Notably, some γH2AX minifoci resulting from the dispersion of the main signal due to chromatin decondensation may bias the quantification of the number of DSBs. We proposed a model called “Christmas light models” to tentatively explain this diversity of γH2AX foci pattern that may also be considered for any DNA damage marker that relocalizes as nuclear foci.">

 How does accurate, unbiased whole genome amplification and tiered, independent, two component analysis impact PGT-A results?



 When compared to previous methods a PGT-A workflow utilizing PTA followed by a CNV and allelic balance-based analysis generated more conclusive results.



 Accurate PGT-A results require unbiased error-free whole genome amplification from the trophectoderm biopsy and smart bioinformatics utilities to fully analyze and consider the large complex datasets. PTA generates fewer errors, greater coverage, and reduced allele drop-out offering the best starting point to interpret the genome of each embryo. Current PGT-A platforms leverage either normalized CNV data OR allelic balance at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to detect alterations in the embryonic genome. A pipeline leveraging improved amplification technology and consolidated CNV and SNP data, particularly for putative mosaic and segmental mosaic calls, could reduce uncertainty and provide more accurate PGT-A results.



 A retrospective analysis of PGT-A results was undertaken with samples originating from multiple clinics and processed in a single laboratory, from January through December, 2023. Approximately 500 samples were processed simultaneously through two independent PGT-A pipelines. The primary objective was to compare the performance of CNV-only PGT-A with a test leveraging both CNV and SNP data. A secondary objective was to observe the resolution of mosaic embryos.



 De-identified samples were amplified with PTA and sequenced with both shotgun (coverage-based CNV) and capture (SNP-based)-approaches. Method specific analysis was applied to the resulting data. An initial bioinformatics approach analyzed CNV data only for variations in copy-number along the genome, proposing stretches of aneuploidy or mosaicism. A second, tiered analysis extended this data and incorporated SNP-based allelic balance to evaluate candidate regions and confirm the presence of aneuploidy and/or quantify mosaic levels.



 Genome-wide read coverage and SNP data confirmed that PTA accurately and completely amplified the genetic material in each sample with broad distribution of informative data and a low allele drop-out rate. High concordance (95%) was observed for euploid and full aneuploid (whole chromosome and segmental) embryos classified with CNV-alone and CNV/SNV combined analysis. SNP data was processed, and B-allele ratios were used to confirm aneuploidies with particular utility in resolving the location of segmental changes. The classification of mosaic samples was altered in the pipeline leveraging both CNV and SNP data. Of 54 mosaic samples tested, 75% remained mosaic after independent consideration of SNP data, ∼15% and 6% of high-level mosaics were resolved to full aneuploid and euploid, respectively, and ∼25% of low-level mosaics reverted to a euploid classification. The deep SNP data produced during targeted sequencing confirmed the altered allele ratio predicted by CNV data and re-confirmed the presence and proportion of aneuploid cells. Mosaic levels were highly correlated in 90% of re-confirmed mosaic samples. This suggests that the classification of these samples as mosaic is precise and accurate and suggests a strong utility for a two component PGT-A pipeline leveraging CNV and SNV data generated from PTA embryos.



 This was a retrospective study with limited sample numbers.



 The study highlights the strong advantages of a hybrid PGT-A pipeline, leveraging PTA and two component analysis of coverage and allelic balance, particularly to resolve mosaic embryos more accurately. Overall, this could reduce uncertainty and deliver more confident PGT-A results for embryo transfer decision making.

        <tr id="Gene conversions are broadly defined as the transfer of genetic material from a ‘donor’ to an ‘acceptor’ sequence and can happen both in meiosis and mitosis. They are a subset of non-crossover events and like crossover events, gene conversion can generate new combinations of alleles, erode linkage disequilibrium, and even counteract the mutation load by reverting germline mutations through GC-biased gene conversion. Estimating the rate of gene conversion and the distribution of gene conversion tract lengths remains challenging. Here, we present a new method for estimating tract length, rate and detection probability of non-crossover events directly in HiFi PacBio long read data. The method can be applied with data from a single individual, is unbiased even under low single nucleotide variant densities and does not necessitate any demographic or evolutionary assumptions. We apply the method to gene conversion events observed directly in Pacbio HiFI read data from a human sperm sample and find that human gene conversion tracts are shorter (mean of 50 base pairs) than estimates from yeast or Drosophila. We also estimate that typical human male gametes undergo on average 280 non-crossover events where approximately 7 are expected to become visible as gene conversions moving variants from one donor haplotype to an acceptor haplotype.">

        <tr id="The p53 family remains a captivating focus of an extensive number of current studies. Accumulating evidence indicates that p53 abnormalities rank among the most prevalent in cancer. Given the numerous existing studies, which mostly focus on the mutations, expression profiles, and functional perturbations exhibited by members of the p53 family across diverse malignancies, this review will concentrate more on less explored facets regarding p53 activation and stabilization by the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in cancer, drawing on several studies. p53 integrates a broad spectrum of signals and is subject to diverse regulatory mechanisms to enact the necessary cellular response. It is widely acknowledged that each stage of p53 regulation, from synthesis to degradation, significantly influences its functionality in executing specific tasks. Over recent decades, a large body of data has established that mechanisms of regulation, closely linked with protein activation and stabilization, involve intricate interactions with various cellular components. These often transcend canonical regulatory pathways. This new knowledge has expanded from the regulation of genes themselves to epigenomics and proteomics, whereby interaction partners increase in number and complexity compared with earlier paradigms. Specifically, studies have recently shown the involvement of the NPC protein in such complex interactions, underscoring the further complexity of p53 regulation. Furthermore, we also discuss therapeutic strategies based on recent developments in this field in combination with established targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="Targeting CDC20 can enhance the radiosensitivity of tumor cells, but the function and mechanism of CDC20 on DNA damage repair response remains vague. To examine that issue, tumor cell lines, including KYSE200, KYSE450, and HCT116, were utilized to detect the expression, function, and underlying mechanism of CDC20 in radio-chemoresistance. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were employed to confirm CDC20 expression and location, and radiation could upregulate the expression of CDC20 in the cell nucleus. The homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) reporter gene systems were utilized to explore the impact of CDC20 on DNA damage repair, indicating that CDC20 could promote HR repair and radio/chemo-resistance. In the early stages of DNA damage, CDC20 stabilizes the RPA1 protein through protein-protein interactions, activating the ATR-mediated signaling cascade, thereby aiding in genomic repair. In the later stages, CDC20 assists in the subsequent steps of damage repair by the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of RPA1. CCK-8 and colony formation assay were used to detect the function of CDC20 in cell vitality and proliferation, and targeting CDC20 can exacerbate the increase in DNA damage levels caused by cisplatin or etoposide. A tumor xenograft model was conducted in BALB/c-nu/nu mice to confirm the function of CDC20 in vivo, confirming the in vitro results. In conclusion, this study provides further validation of the potential clinical significance of CDC20 as a strategy to overcome radio-chemoresistance via uncovering a novel role of CDC20 in regulating RPA1 during DNA damage repair.">

        <tr id="Aneuploidy is nearly ubiquitous in tumor genomes, but the role of aneuploidy in the early stages of cancer evolution remains unclear. Here, by inducing heterogeneous aneuploidy in non-transformed human colon organoids (colonoids), we investigated how the effects of aneuploidy on cell growth and differentiation may promote malignant transformation. Previous work implicated p53 activation as a downstream response to aneuploidy induction. We found that simple aneuploidy, characterized by 1-3 gained or lost chromosomes, resulted in little or modest p53 activation and cell cycle arrest when compared with more complex aneuploid cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the degree of p53 activation was strongly correlated with karyotype complexity. Single-cell tracking showed that cells could continue to divide despite the observation of one to a few lagging chromosomes. Unexpectedly, colonoids with simple aneuploidy exhibited impaired differentiation after niche factor withdrawal. These findings demonstrate that simple aneuploid cells can escape p53 surveillance and may contribute to niche factor-independent growth of cancer-initiating colon stem cells. [Media: see text].">

        <tr id="DNA replication is regulated by factors that promote or inhibit initiation. In Bacillus subtilis, YabA is a negative regulator of DNA replication initiation while the newly identified kinase CcrZ is a positive regulator. The consequences of under-initiation or over-initiation of DNA replication to genome stability remain unclear. In this work, we measure origin to terminus ratios as a proxy for replication initiation activity. We show that ΔccrZ and several ccrZ alleles under-initiate DNA replication while ablation of yabA or overproduction of CcrZ leads to over-initiation. We find that cells under-initiating DNA replication have few incidents of replication fork stress as determined by low formation of RecA-GFP foci compared with wild type. In contrast, cells over-initiating DNA replication show levels of RecA-GFP foci formation analogous to cells directly challenged with DNA damaging agents. We show that cells under-initiating and over-initiating DNA replication were both sensitive to mitomycin C and that changes in replication initiation frequency cause increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress. With these results, we propose that cells under-initiating DNA replication are sensitive to DNA damage due to a shortage of DNA for repair through homologous recombination. For cells over-initiating DNA replication, we propose that an increase in the number of replication forks leads to replication fork stress which is further exacerbated by chromosomal DNA damage. Together, our study shows that DNA replication initiation frequency must be tightly controlled as changes in initiation influence replication fork fate and the capacity of cells to efficiently repair damage to their genetic material. IMPORTANCE The regulation of DNA replication is fundamental to cell growth and cell cycle control. In eukaryotes under-initiation or over-initiation leads to genome instability. For bacteria, it is unclear how changes in replication initiation frequency impact DNA replication status and genome integrity. We show that tight regulation of DNA replication initiation is critical for maintaining genome integrity. Cells over-initiating or under-initiating DNA replication are sensitive to DNA damage. Further, cells over-initiating DNA replication experience replication fork stress at levels that phenocopy cells encountering DNA damage from the crosslinking agent mitomycin C. Our results establish the critical importance of properly regulating DNA replication initiation frequency because an imbalance in initiation results in replication fork perturbations, deficiencies in DNA repair, and genome instability.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM), the most malignant primary brain tumor in adults, has poor prognosis irrespective of therapeutic advances due to its radio-resistance and infiltrative growth into brain tissue. The present study assessed functions and putative druggability of protein breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1)-associated Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-activator 1 (BRAT1) as a crucial factor driving key aspects of GBM, including enhanced DNA damage response and tumor migration. By a stable depletion of BRAT1 in GBM and glioma stem-like (GSC) cell lines, we observed a delay in DNA double-strand break repair and increased sensitivity to radiation treatment, corroborated by in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrating impaired tumor growth and invasion. Proteomic analyses further emphasize the role of BRAT1’s cell migration and invasion capacity, with a notable proportion of downregulated proteins associated with these processes. In line with the genetic manipulation, we found that treatment with the BRAT1 inhibitor Curcusone D (CurD) significantly reduced GSC migration and invasion in an ex vivo slice culture model, particularly when combined with irradiation, resulting a synergistic inhibition of tumor growth and infiltration. Our results reveal that BRAT1 contributes to GBM growth and invasion and suggest that therapeutic inhibition of BRAT1 with CurD or similar compounds might constitute a novel approach for anti-GBM directed treatments.">

These noncanonical structures can act as impediments to DNA polymerase progression along the duplex, thereby triggering DNA damage and ultimately jeopardizing genomic stability. Their stabilization by ad hoc ligands is currently being explored as a putative anticancer strategy since it might represent an efficient way to inflict toxic DNA damage specifically to rapidly dividing cancer cells. The relevance of this strategy is only emerging for three-way DNA junctions (TWJs) and, to date, no molecule has been recognized as a reference TWJ ligand, featuring both high affinity and selectivity. Herein, we characterize such reference ligands through a combination of in vitro techniques comprising affinity and selectivity assays (competitive FRET-melting and TWJ Screen assays), functional tests (qPCR and Taq stop assays), and structural analyses (molecular dynamics and NMR investigations). We identify novel azacryptands TrisNP-amphi and TrisNP-ana as the most promising ligands, interacting with TWJs with high affinity and selectivity. These ligands represent new molecular tools to investigate the cellular roles of TWJs and explore how they can be exploited in innovative anticancer therapies.">

        <tr id="YAP is a central player in cancer development with functions extending beyond its recognized role in cell growth regulation. Recent work has identified a link between YAP/TAZ and the DNA damage response. Here, we investigated the mechanistic underpinnings of the crosstalk between DNA damage repair and YAP activity. Ku70, a key component of the non-homologous end joining pathway to repair DNA damage, engaged in a dynamic competition with TEAD4 for binding to YAP, limiting the transcriptional activity of YAP. Depletion of Ku70 enhanced interaction between YAP and TEAD4 and boosted YAP transcriptional capacity. Consequently, Ku70 loss enhanced tumorigenesis in colon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vivo. YAP impeded DNA damage repair and elevated genome instability by inducing PARP1 degradation through the SMURF2-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Analysis of HCC patient samples substantiated the link between Ku70 expression, YAP activity, PARP1 levels, and genome instability. In conclusion, this research provides insight into the mechanistic interactions between YAP and key regulators of DNA damage repair, highlighting the role of a Ku70-YAP-PARP1 axis in preserving genome stability.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Detection of minor DNA allele alterations is becoming increasingly important for early detection and monitoring of cancer. We describe a new method that uses ultraviolet light to eliminate wild-type DNA alleles and enables improved detection of minor genetic or epigenetic changes.


METHODS
Pyrimidine-dependent UV-based minor-allele enrichment (PD-UVME) employed oligonucleotide probes that incorporated a UVA-sensitive 3-cyanovinylcarbazole (CNVK), placed directly opposite interrogated pyrimidines, such as thymine (T) or cytosine (C) in wild-type (WT) DNA. Upon UVA-illumination, CNVK cross-linked with T/C, preventing subsequent amplification. Mutations that removed the T/C escaped cross-linking and were amplified and detected. Similarly, CNVK discriminated between methylated and unmethylated cytosine in CpG dinucleotides, enabling direct enrichment of unmethylated DNA targets. PD-UVME was combined with digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) to detect serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf (BRAF) V600E mutations in model systems, thyroid patient cancer tissue samples, and circulating DNA of tumor origin (ctDNA) from melanoma patients.


RESULTS
One thyroid cancer sample out of 9, and 6 circulating-DNA samples out of 7 were found to be BRAF V600E-positive via PD-UVME while classified as negative by conventional ddPCR. Positive samples via conventional ddPCR were also found positive via PD-UVME. All 10 circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples obtained from normal volunteers were negative via both approaches. Furthermore, preferential enrichment of unmethylated alleles in MAGEA1 promoters using PD-UVME was demonstrated.


CONCLUSIONS
PD-UVME mutation/methylation enrichment performed prior to ddPCR magnifies low-level mutations or epigenetic changes and increases sensitivity and confidence in the results. It can assist with clinical decisions that hinge on the presence of trace alterations like BRAF V600E.">

Based on data from databases, we conducted a multivariable omics analysis on HRD in 33 cancer types, focusing mainly on 23 cancers in which HRD was significantly associated with patient overall survival (OS) rates. This analysis included the mechanisms related to patient prognosis, gene expression, gene mutation, and signaling pathways. In this study, HRD was found to be significantly associated with patient prognosis, but its impact varied among different cancers. HRD was linked to different outcomes for patients with distinct tumor subtypes and was correlated with clinical features such as clinical stage and tumor grade. Driver gene mutations, including TP53, MUC4, KRAS, HRAS, FLG, ANK3, BRCA2, ATRX, FGFR3, NFE2L2, MAP3K1, PIK3CA, CIC, FUBP1, ALB, CTNNB1, and MED12, were associated with HRD across specific cancer types. We also analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in relation to HRD levels in these cancers. Furthermore, we explored the correlation between HRD and signaling pathways, as well as immune cell infiltration. Overall, our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of HRD's multifaceted role in cancer.">

        <tr id="CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is an insulator protein that binds to a highly conserved DNA motif and facilitates regulation of three-dimensional (3D) nuclear architecture and transcription. CTCF binding sites (CTCF-BSs) reside in non-coding DNA and are frequently mutated in cancer. Our previous study identified a small subclass of CTCF-BSs that are resistant to CTCF knock down, termed persistent CTCF binding sites (P-CTCF-BSs). P-CTCF-BSs show high binding conservation and potentially regulate cell-type constitutive 3D chromatin architecture. Here, using ICGC sequencing data we made the striking observation that P-CTCF-BSs display a highly elevated mutation rate in breast and prostate cancer when compared to all CTCF-BSs. To address whether P-CTCF-BS mutations are also enriched in other cell-types, we developed CTCF-INSITE-a tool utilising machine learning to predict persistence based on genetic and epigenetic features of experimentally-determined P-CTCF-BSs. Notably, predicted P-CTCF-BSs also show a significantly elevated mutational burden in all 12 cancer-types tested. Enrichment was even stronger for P-CTCF-BS mutations with predicted functional impact to CTCF binding and chromatin looping. Using in vitro binding assays we validated that P-CTCF-BS cancer mutations, predicted to be disruptive, indeed reduced CTCF binding. Together this study reveals a new subclass of cancer specific CTCF-BS DNA mutations and provides insights into their importance in genome organization in a pan-cancer setting.">

Current methods suffer from low insertion efficiency and most rely on undesired double-strand DNA breaks. Serine integrases catalyze the insertion of large DNA cargos at attachment (att) sites. By targeting att sites to the genome using technologies such as prime editing, integrases can target safe loci while avoiding double-strand breaks. We developed a method of phage-assisted continuous evolution we call IntePACE, that we used to rapidly perform hundreds of rounds of mutagenesis to systematically improve activity of PhiC31 and Bxb1 serine integrases. Novel hyperactive mutants were generated by combining synergistic mutations resulting in integration of a multi-gene cargo at rates as high as 80% of target chromosomes. Hyperactive integrases inserted a 15.7 kb therapeutic DNA cargo containing Von Willebrand Factor. This technology could accelerate gene delivery therapeutics and our directed evolution strategy can easily be adapted to improve novel integrases from nature.">

        <tr id="The major histocompatibility (MHC) locus, also known as the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes, is located on the short arm of chromosome 6, and contains three regions (Class I, Class II and Class III). This 5 Mbp locus is one of the most variable regions of the human genome, yet it also encodes a set of highly conserved and important proteins related to immunological response. Genetic variations in this region are responsible for more diseases than in the entire rest of the human genome. However, information on local structural features of the DNA is largely ignored. With recent advances in long-read sequencing technology, it is now becoming possible to sequence the entire 5 Mbp MHC locus, producing complete diploid haplotypes of the whole region. Here, we describe structural maps based on the complete sequences from six different homozygous HLA cell lines. We find long-range structural variability in the different sequences for DNA stacking energy, position preference and curvature, variation in repeats, as well as more local changes in regions forming open chromatin structures, likely to influence gene expression levels. These structural maps can be useful in visualizing large scale structural variation across HLA types, in particular when this can be complemented with epigenetic signals.">

        <tr id="Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is a cancer that arises in the bones and soft tissues, typically driven by the Ewing’s sarcoma breakpoint region 1-Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (EWS-FLI) oncogene. Implementation of genetically modified animal models of EwS has proved difficult largely owing to EWS-FLI’s high toxicity. The EWS-FLI1FS frameshift variant that circumvents toxicity but is still able to perform key oncogenic functions provided the first study model in Drosophila. However, the quest for Drosophila lines expressing full-length, unmodified EWS-FLI remained open. Here, we show that EWS-FLI1FS’s lower toxicity is owed to reduced protein levels caused by its frameshifted C-terminal peptide, and report new strategies through which we have generated Drosophila lines that express full-length, unmodified EWS-FLI. Using these lines, we have found that the upregulation of transcription from GGAA-microsatellites (GGAAμSats) presents a positive linear correlation within a wide range of EWS-FLI protein concentrations. In contrast, rather counterintuitively, GGAAμSats-independent transcriptomic dysregulation presents relatively minor differences across the same range, suggesting that GGAAμSat-dependent and -independent transcriptional upregulation present different kinetics of response with regards to changing EWS-FLI protein concentration. Our results underpin the functional relevance of varying EWS-FLI expression levels and provide experimental tools to investigate, in Drosophila, the effect of the EWS-FLI ‘high’ and ‘low’ states that have been reported and are suspected to be important for EwS in humans.">

        <tr id="Introduction The DNA damage repair (DDR) system in human genome is pivotal in maintaining genomic integrity. Pathogenic variation (PV) in DDR genes impairs their function, leading to genome instability and increased susceptibility to diseases, especially cancer. Understanding the evolution origin and arising time of DDR PV is crucial for comprehending disease susceptibility in modern humans. Methods We used big data approach to identify the PVs in DDR genes in modern humans. We mined multiple genomic databases derived from 251,214 modern humans of African and non-Africans. We compared the DDR PVs between African and non-African. We also mined the DDR PVs in the genomic data derived from 5,031 ancient humans. We used the DDR PVs from ancient humans as the intermediate to further the DDR PVs between African and non-African. Results and discussion We identified 1,060 single-base DDR PVs across 77 DDR genes in modern humans of African and non-African. Direct comparison of the DDR PVs between African and non-African showed that 82.1% of the non-African PVs were not present in African. We further identified 397 single-base DDR PVs in 56 DDR genes in the 5,031 ancient humans dated between 45,045 and 100 years before present (BP) lived in Eurasian continent therefore the descendants of the latest out-of-Africa human migrants occurred 50,000–60,000 years ago. By referring to the ancient DDR PVs, we observed that 276 of the 397 (70.3%) ancient DDR PVs were exclusive in non-African, 106 (26.7%) were shared between non-African and African, and only 15 (3.8%) were exclusive in African. We further validated the distribution pattern by testing the PVs in BRCA and TP53, two of the important genes in genome stability maintenance, in African, non-African, and Ancient humans. Our study revealed that DDR PVs in modern humans mostly emerged after the latest out-of-Africa migration. The data provides a foundation to understand the evolutionary basis of disease susceptibility, in particular cancer, in modern humans.">

        <tr id="Genome editing is a technology to make specific changes in the DNA of a cell or an organism. It has significantly altered the landscape of life sciences, facilitating the establishment of exceedingly customized genetic modifications. Among various genome editing technologies, the CRISPR/Cas9 system, a specific endonuclease induces a double stranded DNA break and enabling modifications to the genome, has surfaced as a formidable and adaptable instrument. Its significance cannot be overstated, as it not only allows for the manipulation of genomes in model organisms but also holds great potential for revolutionary advances in medicine, particularly in treating genetic diseases. This review paper explores the remarkable journey of CRISPR/Cas9, its natural function, mechanisms, and transformative impact on genome editing and finally the use of artificial intelligence and other intelligent manufacturing tools used. The introduction provides the background on genome editing, emphasizing the emergence and significance of CRISPR/Cas9. Subsequent sections comprehensively elucidate its natural function, disease modeling, agriculture, and biotechnology, address therapeutic applications, and ongoing clinical trials while also discussing prospects and ethical implications. We summarized the key findings, indicating that CRISPR/Cas9 has empowered the creation of disease-specific animal models. This provides invaluable insights into pathogenic mechanisms and opens new avenues for drug discovery, reaffirming the transformative impact of CRISPR/Cas9 on genome editing. Finally we discussed the importance of continued research and collaboration for comprehensive utilization of the inherent capabilities of this molecular precision tool in shaping forthcoming advancements.">

        <tr id="While balanced reciprocal translocations are relatively common, they often remain clinically silent unless they lead to the disruption of functional genes. In this study, we present the case of a boy exhibiting developmental delay and mild intellectual disability. Initial karyotyping revealed a translocation t(5;6)(q13;q23) between chromosomes 5 and 6 with limited resolution. Optical genome mapping (OGM) enabled a more precise depiction of the breakpoint regions involved in the reciprocal translocation. While the breakpoint region on chromosome 6 did not encompass any known gene, OGM revealed the disruption of the RASGRF2 (Ras protein-specific guanine nucleotide releasing factor 2) gene on chromosome 5, implicating RASGRF2 as a potential candidate gene contributing to the observed developmental delay in the patient. Variations in RASGRF2 have so far not been reported in developmental delay, but research on the RASGRF2 gene underscores its significance in various aspects of neurodevelopment, including synaptic plasticity, signaling pathways, and behavioral responses. This study highlights the utility of OGM in identifying breakpoint regions, providing possible insights into the understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders. It also helps affected individuals in gaining more knowledge about potential causes of their conditions.">

        <tr id="Horizontal gene transfer is a key driver of bacterial evolution, but it also presents severe risks to bacteria by introducing invasive mobile genetic elements. To counter these threats, bacteria have developed various defense systems, including prokaryotic Argonautes (pAgo) and the DNA Defense Module DdmDE system. Through biochemical analysis, structural determination, and in vivo plasmid clearance assays, we elucidate the assembly and activation mechanisms of DdmDE, which eliminates small, multicopy plasmids. We demonstrate that DdmE, a pAgo-like protein, acts as a catalytically inactive, DNA-guided, DNA-targeting defense module. In the presence of guide DNA, DdmE targets plasmids and recruits a dimeric DdmD, which contains nuclease and helicase domains. Upon binding to DNA substrates, DdmD transitions from an autoinhibited dimer to an active monomer, which then translocates along and cleaves the plasmids. Together, our findings reveal the intricate mechanisms underlying DdmDE-mediated plasmid clearance, offering fundamental insights into bacterial defense systems against plasmid invasions.">

        <tr id="Formaldehyde (FA) is a recognized environmental and metabolic toxin implicated in cancer development and aging. Inherited mutations in the FA-detoxifying enzymes ADH5 and ALDH2 genes lead to FA overload in the severe multisystem AMeD syndrome. FA accumulation causes genome damage including DNA-protein-, inter- and intra-strand crosslinks and oxidative lesions. However, the influence of distinct DNA repair systems on organismal FA resistance remains elusive. We have here investigated the consequence of a range of DNA repair mutants in a model of endogenous FA overload generated by downregulating the orthologs of human ADH5 and ALDH2 in C. elegans. We have focused on the distinct components of nucleotide excision repair (NER) during developmental growth, reproduction and aging. Our results reveal three distinct modes of repair of FA-induced DNA damage: Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) operating NER-independently during developmental growth or through NER during adulthood, and, in concert with global-genome (GG-) NER, in the germline and early embryonic development. Additionally, we show that the Cockayne syndrome B (CSB) factor is involved in the resolution of FA-induced DNA-protein crosslinks, and that the antioxidant and FA quencher N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) reverses the sensitivity of detoxification and DNA repair defects during development, suggesting a therapeutic intervention to revert FA-pathogenic consequences.">

        <tr id="The Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1-like (CHD1L) is a nucleosome remodeling enzyme, which plays a key role in chromatin relaxation during the DNA damage response. Genome editing has shown that deletion of CHD1L sensitizes cells to PARPi, but the effect of its pharmacological inhibition has not been defined. Triple-negative breast cancer SUM149PT, HCC1937, and MDA-MB-231 cells were used to assess the mechanism of action of the CHD1Li OTI-611. Cytotoxicity as a single agent or in combination with standard-of-care treatments was assessed in tumor organoids. Immunofluorescence was used to assess the translocation of PAR and AIF to the cytoplasm or the nucleus and to study markers of DNA damage or apoptosis. Trapping of PARP1/2 or CHD1L onto chromatin was also assessed by in situ subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence and validated by Western blot. We show that the inhibition of CHD1L’s ATPase activity by OTI-611 is cytotoxic to triple-negative breast cancer tumor organoids and synergizes with PARPi and chemotherapy independently of the BRCA mutation status. The inhibition of the remodeling function blocks the phosphorylation of H2AX, traps CHD1L on chromatin, and leaves PAR chains on PARP1/2 open for hydrolysis. PAR hydrolysis traps PARP1/2 at DNA damage sites and mediates PAR translocation to the cytoplasm, release of AIF from the mitochondria, and induction of PARthanatos. The targeted inhibition of CHD1L’s oncogenic function by OTI-611 signifies an innovative therapeutic strategy for breast cancer and other cancers. This approach capitalizes on CHD1L-mediated DNA repair and cell survival vulnerabilities, thereby creating synergy with standard-of-care therapies">

        <tr id="Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) are pivotal in regenerative medicine, yet their in vitro expansion often leads to genetic abnormalities, raising concerns about their safety in clinical applications. This study analyzed ten human embryonic stem cell lines across multiple passages to elucidate the dynamics of chromosomal abnormalities and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 380 cancer-related genes. Prolonged in vitro culture resulted in 80% of the lines acquiring gains of chromosomes 20q or 1q, both known for conferring in vitro growth advantage. 70% of lines also acquired other copy number variants (CNVs) outside the recurrent set. Additionally, we detected 122 SNVs in 88 genes, with all lines acquiring at least one de novo SNV during culture. Our findings show higher loads of both CNVs and SNVs at later passages which are due to the cumulative acquisition of mutations over a longer time in culture and not to an increased rate of mutagenesis over time. Importantly, we observed that SNVs and rare CNVs follow the acquisition of chromosomal gains in 1q and 20q, while most of the low-passage and genetically balanced samples were devoid cancer-associated mutations. This suggests that the recurrent chromosomal abnormalities are the potential drivers for the acquisition of other mutations.">

        <tr id="Citrus canker, caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc), is a devastating disease worldwide. Previously, we successfully generated canker-resistant Citrus sinensis cv. Hamlin lines in the T0 generation, achieving a mutation efficiency of 97.4%. This was achieved through the transformation of embryogenic protoplasts using the Cas12a/1 crRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) system to edit the canker susceptibility gene, CsLOB1, which led to small indels. Here, we transformed embryogenic protoplasts of Hamlin with Cas12a/3 crRNAs RNP, resulting in 100% efficiency in editing the CsLOB1 gene in the T0 generation. Among the 10 transgene-free genome-edited lines, long deletions were obtained in five lines. Additionally, inversions were observed in three of the five edited lines with long deletions, but not in any edited lines with short indel mutations, suggesting long deletions are required for inversions. Biallelic mutations were observed for each of the three target sites in 4 of the 10 edited lines when 3 crRNAs were used, demonstrating that transformation of embryogenic citrus protoplasts with Cas12a/3 crRNAs RNP can be very efficient for multiplex editing. Our analysis revealed the absence of off-target mutations in the edited lines. These cslob1 mutant lines were canker-resistant and no canker symptoms were observed after inoculation with Xcc and Xcc growth was significantly reduced in the cslob1 mutant lines compared to the wild type plants. Taken together, Cas12a/3 crRNAs RNP transformation of embryogenic protoplasts of citrus provides a promising solution for transgene-free multiplex genome editing with high efficiency and for deletion of long fragments.">

        <tr id="Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the most universal repair pathway, which removes a wide range of DNA helix-distorting lesions caused by chemical or physical agents. The final steps of this repair process are gap-filling repair synthesis and subsequent ligation. XPA is the central NER scaffolding protein factor and can be involved in post-incision NER stages. Replication machinery is loaded after the first incision of the damaged strand that is performed by the XPF–ERCC1 nuclease forming a damaged 5′-flap processed by the XPG endonuclease. Flap endonuclease I (FEN1) is a critical component of replication machinery and is absolutely indispensable for the maturation of newly synthesized strands. FEN1 also contributes to the long-patch pathway of base excision repair. Here, we use a set of DNA substrates containing a fluorescently labeled 5′-flap and different size gap to analyze possible repair factor–replication factor interactions. Ternary XPA–FEN1–DNA complexes with each tested DNA are detected. Furthermore, we demonstrate XPA–FEN1 complex formation in the absence of DNA due to protein–protein interaction. Functional assays reveal that XPA moderately inhibits FEN1 catalytic activity. Using fluorescently labeled XPA, formation of ternary RPA–XPA–FEN1 complex, where XPA accommodates FEN1 and RPA contacts simultaneously, can be proposed. We discuss possible functional roles of the XPA–FEN1 interaction in NER related DNA resynthesis and/or other DNA metabolic processes where XPA can be involved in the complex with FEN1.">

The dysregulated activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs) has been associated with retinoblastoma pathogenesis, influencing critical cellular processes like cell cycle regulation or retinal ganglion cell apoptosis. Through their deacetylase activity, HDACs exert control over key tumor suppressors and oncogenes, influencing the delicate equilibrium between proliferation and cell death. Furthermore, the interplay between HDACs and the retinoblastoma protein pathway, a pivotal aspect of retinoblastoma etiology, reveals a complex network of interactions influencing the tumor microenvironment. The examination of HDAC inhibitors, encompassing both established and novel compounds, offers insights into potential approaches to restore acetylation balance and impede retinoblastoma progression. Moreover, the identification of specific HDAC isoforms exhibiting varying expression in retinoblastoma provides avenues for personalized therapeutic strategies, allowing for interventions tailored to individual patient profiles. This review focuses on the intricate interrelationship between HDACs and retinoblastoma, shedding light on epigenetic mechanisms that control tumor development and progression. The exploration of HDAC-targeted therapies underscores the potential for innovative treatment modalities in the pursuit of more efficacious and personalized management strategies for this disease.">

It dates back more than a million years; more importantly, tumor cells can not be detected until they grow to a large number. Currently, cancers are treated with surgical excision or non-surgical procedures. By studying the interaction between ncRNAs and PKM2, we aim to provide new targets for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis for cancers. Read relevant articles and made a summary and classification. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are RNAs that do not code for proteins. They perform a function in transcription and translation and can be used as targets for cancer therapy. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a form of PKM, and it catalyzes the glycolysis of the final cellular processes to promote tumorigenesis. Not only that, but it also plays non-metabolic functions, including the expression of the gene, cell proliferation, cell migration, and tumor angiogenesis in cancer cells. The existing studies have found that microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) can promote or inhibit the aerobic glycolysis of cancer cells by affecting PKM2, which increases or decrease the risk of cancers and affect the progression of cancers. This review focuses on the mechanism of ncRNAs regulating PKM2 in cancers and summarizes the roles of some ncRNAs.">

Conversely, aberrantly activated EPAS1HIF2α acts as a tumor driver against which anti-tumor therapeutics are proven effective. We elucidated connections between adaptation to systemic hypoxia in high-altitude populations, such as Tibetans and Sherpas, and human tumors. Similar to the accelerated adaptability observed in high-altitude populations via genetic introgression, tumors from patients with hypoxia since birth exhibited impaired DNA repair and increased mutation burden. As in high-altitude dwellers, EPAS1HIF2α genetic variants were positively selected within sympathetic tumors developed under hypoxia, with a consistently high frequency of 90%. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing followed by in vitro studies have shown that hypoxia and EPAS1HIF2α gain-of-function tumor mutations induce COX4i2 expression and impair mitochondrial respiration, indicating that decreased cellular oxygen consumption may confer a proliferative advantage in hypoxia. Analyzing medical data from a patient cohort with hypoxia since birth who developed/did not develop tumors revealed tissue-specific and time-dependent tumorigenic effects of systemic hypoxia, which is limited to oxygen-sensitive and responsive cells, particularly during the postnatal period. This study supports connections between the EPAS1HIF2α genetic adaptation in human tumors developed under systemic hypoxia to populations living in high altitudes. The genetic adaptations in populations to different stressors can be explored further to understand tumorigenesis and tumor evolution.">

        <tr id="Over 50 hereditary degenerative disorders are caused by expansions of short tandem DNA repeats (STRs). (GAA)n repeat expansions are responsible for Friedreich’s ataxia as well as late-onset cerebellar ataxias (LOCAs). Thus, the mechanisms of (GAA)n repeat expansions attract broad scientific attention. To investigate the role of DNA nicks in this process, we utilized a CRISPR-Cas9 nickase system to introduce targeted nicks adjacent to the (GAA)n repeat tract. We found that DNA nicks 5’ of the (GAA)100 run led to a dramatic increase in both the rate and scale of its expansion in dividing cells. Strikingly, they also promoted large-scale expansions of carrier- and large normal-size (GAA)n repeats, recreating, for the first time in a model system, the expansion events that occur in human pedigrees. DNA nicks 3’ of the (GAA)100 repeat led to a smaller but significant increase in the expansion rate as well. Our genetic analysis implies that in dividing cells, conversion of nicks into double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication followed by DSB or fork repair leads to repeat expansions. Finally, we showed that 5’ strand nicks increase expansion frequency in non-dividing yeast cells, albeit to a lesser extent that in dividing cells.">

        <tr id="Polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) are characterized by the presence of either a single enlarged nucleus or multiple nuclei and are closely associated with tumor progression and treatment resistance. These cells contribute significantly to cellular heterogeneity and can arise from various stressors, including radiation, chemotherapy, hypoxia, and environmental factors. The formation of PGCCs can occur through mechanisms such as endoreplication, cell fusion, cytokinesis failure, mitotic slippage, or cell cannibalism. Notably, PGCCs exhibit traits similar to cancer stem cells (CSCs) and generate highly invasive progeny through asymmetric division. The presence of PGCCs and their progeny is pivotal in conferring resistance to chemotherapy and radiation, as well as facilitating tumor recurrence and metastasis. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the origins, potential formation mechanisms, stressors, unique characteristics, and regulatory pathways of PGCCs, alongside therapeutic strategies targeting these cells. The objective is to enhance the understanding of PGCC initiation and progression, offering novel insights into tumor biology.">

 How does maternal aging impact DNA damage accumulation and DNA repair capacity in mammalian oocytes?



 Age-related changes in DNA repair compartments and chromatin organisation drive DNA damage accumulation in aged oocytes, ultimately contributing to the decline in DNA repair capacity.



 Oocyte loss occurs progressively from birth and accelerates as women approach their mid-30s, posing a significant challenge to female reproductive health. Recent studies have highlighted the role of the DNA repair response in driving ovarian ageing and oocyte loss. Aged oocytes accumulate elevated levels of DNA damage. Unless repaired, persistent DNA damage activates DNA repair checkpoints, causing the elimination of defective oocytes. Although we know DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in oocytes increase with maternal age, surprisingly, little is known about why this damage is not repaired efficiently.



 Oocytes were isolated from ovaries of 8 weeks or 68-86-week-old CD1 mice, which correspond to reproductively young and old females respectively. Over 600 and 1000 oocytes from aged any young females were used to analyse DNA damage levels, DNA repair effciency, DNA repair compartments and for other live assays.



 DNA damage was induced in CD1 oocytes from young and aged mice using neocarzinostatin. Levels of DNA damage and DNA repair proteins were quantified using immunofluoresnce confocal/STED microscopy. High-resolution light sheet microscopy was used to perform live imaging of dynamics of DNA damage foci and chromosome segregation during meiosis.



 Our work demonstrates that aged oocytes have a lower DNA repair capacity and reduced mobility of DNA damage sites compared to young oocytes. We further show that incomplete DNA repair results in defective chromosome integrity and partitioning, thereby compromising oocyte quality. To investigate the causes of the age-related decline in DNA repair, we systematically studied the localization and abundance of several DNA repair proteins in oocytes from young and aged mice. We found that DNA repair proteins localized in spatially distinct DNA repair compartments in oocyte nuclei, that form during the late stages of oocyte growth, accompanied by changes in the activity of DNA repair pathways. Several DNA repair proteins, their corresponding compartments, and their response to DNA damage were altered in aged oocytes. Lastly, we demonstrate that age-related cohesin loss increases DNA damage levels and reduces DNA repair capacity. We hypothesize that cohesin dissociation with maternal ageing may make chromosomes prone to accumulate DNA damage without proper DNA repair. Thus, age-related changes in DNA repair compartments and chromatin organisation drive DNA damage accumulation in aged oocytes, ultimately contributing to the decline in reproductive potential.



 Neocarzinostatin, a radiomimetic drug used to induce DNA DSBs in mouse oocytes in vitro, may not fully represent sources of DNA damage during aging. The CD1 mouse model and ages were selected to recapitulate equivalent advanced maternal age in women. Further investigation is needed to confirm these findings in humans.



 Overall, we propose that altered DNA repair machinery and cohesin loss contribute to persistent DNA damage and reduced DNA repair capacity in aged oocytes, which can cause chromosome defects and fragmentation, and eventually trigger oocyte death, thereby accelerating the loss of female fertility.

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BRCA) remains a significant global health challenge due to its prevalence and lethality, exacerbated by the development of resistance to conventional therapies. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning chemoresistance is crucial for improving therapeutic outcomes. Human deoxycytidine triphosphate pyrophosphatase 1 (DCTPP1) has emerged as a key player in various cancers, including BRCA. DCTPP1, involved in nucleotide metabolism and maintenance of genomic stability, has been linked to cancer cell proliferation, survival, and drug resistance. This study evaluates the role of DCTPP1 in BRCA prognosis and chemotherapy response. Data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repositories, analyzed using GEPIA and Kaplan–Meier Plotter, indicate that high DCTPP1 expression correlates with poorer overall survival and increased resistance to chemotherapy in BRCA patients. Further analysis reveals that DCTPP1 gene expression is up-regulated in non-responders to chemotherapy, particularly in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, luminal A subtype patients, with significant predictive power. Additionally, in vitro studies show that DCTPP1 gene expression increases in response to 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin treatments in luminal A BRCA cell lines, suggesting a hypothetical role in chemoresistance. These findings highlight DCTPP1 as a potential biomarker for predicting chemotherapy response and as a therapeutic target to enhance chemotherapy efficacy in BRCA patients.">

        <tr id="The repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) is crucial for the maintenance of genome stability and cell viability. DSB repair (DSBR) in cells is mediated through several mechanisms: homologous recombination (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), and single strand annealing (SSA). Cellular assays are essential to measure the proficiency and modulation of these pathways in response to various stimuli. Here, we present a suite of extrachromosomal reporter assays that each measure the reconstitution of a nanoluciferase reporter gene by one of the four major DSBR pathways in cells. Upon transient transfection into cells of interest, repair of pathway-specific reporter substrates can be measured in under 24 h by the detection of Nanoluciferase (NanoLuc) luminescence. These robust assays are quantitative, sensitive, titratable, and amenable to a high-throughput screening format. These properties provide broad applications in DNA repair research and drug discovery, complementing the currently available toolkit of cellular DSBR assays.">

        <tr id="Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a mechanism of DNA damage tolerance utilized by eukaryotic cells to replicate DNA across lesions that impede the high-fidelity replication machinery. In TLS, a series of specialized DNA polymerases are employed, which recognize specific DNA lesions, insert nucleotides across the damage, and extend the distorted primer-template. This allows cells to preserve genetic integrity at the cost of mutations. In humans, TLS enzymes include the Y-family, inserter polymerases, Polη, Polι, Polκ, Rev1, and the B-family extender polymerase Polζ, while in S. cerevisiae only Polη, Rev1, and Polζ are present. To bypass DNA lesions, TLS polymerases cooperate, assembling into a complex on the eukaryotic sliding clamp, PCNA, termed the TLS mutasome. The mutasome assembly is contingent on protein–protein interactions (PPIs) between the modular domains and subunits of TLS enzymes, and their interactions with PCNA and DNA. While the structural mechanisms of DNA lesion bypass by the TLS polymerases and PPIs of their individual modules are well understood, the mechanisms by which they cooperate in the context of TLS complexes have remained elusive. This review focuses on structural studies of TLS polymerases and describes the case of TLS holoenzyme assemblies in action emerging from recent high-resolution Cryo-EM studies.">

        <tr id="Maintenance of DNA integrity is essential to all forms of life. DNA damage generated by reaction with genotoxic chemicals results in deleterious mutations, genome instability, and cell death. Pathogenic bacteria encounter several genotoxic agents during infection. In keeping with this, the loss of DNA repair networks results in virulence attenuation in several bacterial species. Interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICLs) are a type of DNA lesion formed by covalent linkage of opposing DNA strands and are particularly toxic as they interfere with replication and transcription. Bacteria have evolved specialized DNA glycosylases that unhook ICLs, thereby initiating their repair. In this study, we describe AlkX, a DNA glycosylase encoded by the multidrug resistant pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii. AlkX exhibits ICL unhooking activity similar to that of its Escherichia coli homolog YcaQ. Interrogation of the in vivo role of AlkX revealed that its loss sensitizes cells to DNA crosslinking and impairs A. baumannii colonization of the lungs and dissemination to distal tissues during pneumonia. These results suggest that AlkX participates in A. baumannii pathogenesis and protects the bacterium from stress conditions encountered in vivo. Consistent with this, we found that acidic pH, an environment encountered during host colonization, results in A. baumannii DNA damage and that alkX is induced by, and contributes to, defense against acidic conditions. Collectively, these studies reveal functions for a recently described class of proteins encoded in a broad range of pathogenic bacterial species.">
