        <tr id="In cancer, complex genome rearrangements and other structural alterations, including the amplification of oncogenes on circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) elements, drive the formation and progression of tumors. ecDNA is a particularly challenging structural alteration. By untethering oncogenes from chromosomal constraints, it elevates oncogene copy number, drives intratumoral genetic heterogeneity, promotes rapid tumor evolution, and results in treatment resistance. The profound changes in DNA shape and nuclear architecture generated by ecDNA alter the transcriptional landscape of tumors by catalyzing new types of regulatory interactions that do not occur on chromosomes. The current suite of tools for interrogating cancer genomes is well suited for deciphering sequence but has limited ability to resolve the complex changes in DNA structure and dynamics that ecDNA generates. Here, we review the challenges of resolving ecDNA form and function and discuss the emerging tool kit for deciphering ecDNA architecture and spatial organization, including what has been learned to date about how this dramatic change in shape alters tumor development, progression, and drug resistance. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics, Volume 23 is October 2022.

        <tr id="Human genes are arranged on 23 pairs of chromosomes, but in cancer, tumor-promoting genes and regulatory elements can free themselves from chromosomes and relocate to circular, extrachromosomal pieces of DNA (ecDNA). ecDNA, because of its nonchromosomal inheritance, drives high-copy-number oncogene amplification and enables tumors to evolve their genomes rapidly. Furthermore, the circular ecDNA architecture fundamentally alters gene regulation and transcription, and the higher-order organization of ecDNA contributes to tumor pathogenesis. Consequently, patients whose cancers harbor ecDNA have significantly shorter survival. Although ecDNA was first observed more than 50 years ago, its critical importance has only recently come to light. In this review, we discuss the current state of understanding of how ecDNAs form and function as well as how they contribute to drug resistance and accelerated cancer evolution.

        <tr id="Extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) are prevalent in human cancers and mediate high oncogene expression through elevated copy number and altered gene regulation1. Gene expression typically involves distal enhancer DNA elements that contact and activate genes on the same chromosome2,3. Here we show that ecDNA hubs, comprised of ~10-100 ecDNAs clustered in the nucleus of interphase cells, drive intermolecular enhancer input for amplified oncogene expression. Single-molecule sequencing, single-cell multiome, and 3D enhancer connectome reveal subspecies of MYC-PVT1 ecDNAs lacking enhancers that access intermolecular and ectopic enhancer-promoter interactions in ecDNA hubs. ecDNA hubs persist without transcription and are tethered by BET protein BRD4. BET inhibitor JQ1 disperses ecDNA hubs, preferentially inhibits ecDNA oncogene transcription, and kills ecDNA+ cancer cells. Two amplified oncogenes MYC and FGFR2 intermix in ecDNA hubs, engage in intermolecular enhancer-promoter interactions, and transcription is uniformly sensitive to JQ1. Thus, ecDNA hubs are nuclear bodies of many ecDNAs tethered by proteins and platforms for cooperative transcription, leveraging the power of oncogene diversification and combinatorial DNA interactions. We suggest ecDNA hubs, rather than individual ecDNAs, as units of oncogene function, cooperative evolution, and new targets for cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Structural variants (SVs) represent a mechanism by which cancer cells activate oncogenes or disrupt the function of genes with tumor suppressor roles. A recent study by the PCAWG Consortium investigated structural variants in 30 tumor types, identifying focal rearrangements in the oncogenic BRD4 gene in ovarian, endometrial and breast cancers. These rearrangements resulted in decreased BRD4 expression despite increased copy number, suggesting a novel mechanism to finetune gene over-expression. In this study, we show that focal deletions of BRD4 disrupt genomic regulatory regions and impact gene isoform expression in breast and ovarian tumors when compared to their expression across normal tissues. To determine the functional impact of these concomitant amplification and focal deletion events, we first leveraged open-reading-frame (ORF) screen data from 16 cancer cell lines, where we observed that overexpression of BRD4-long and BRD4-short isoforms is toxic for cancer cell growth. We confirmed these results in OVSAHO ovarian cancer cells, where overexpression of both isoforms significantly reduced tumor growth. Next, we mimicked the focal deletions occurring in BRD4 regulatory regions by CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and observed that their depletion functionally ablates tumor cell growth. We finally show that these focal deletions rescue ovarian carcinoma cells from the toxicity effects associated with gene overexpression, suggesting that global BRD4 gene expression levels must be fine tuned to ensure proper cancer cell proliferation. Our study provides experimental evidence for BRD4 deletions constituting the first example of a driver SV alteration reducing toxicity in cancer, therefore expanding the landscape of cancer progression mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Abstract Recently, the cancer community has gained a heightened awareness of the roles of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in cancer proliferation, drug resistance and epigenetic remodeling. However, a hindrance to studying ecDNA is the lack of available cancer model systems that express ecDNA. Increasing our awareness of which model systems express ecDNA will advance our understanding of fundamental ecDNA biology and unlock a wealth of potential targeting strategies for ecDNA-driven cancers. To bridge this gap, we created CytoCellDB, a resource that provides karyotype annotations for cell lines within the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). We identify 139 cell lines that express ecDNA, a 200% increase from what is currently known. We expanded the total number of cancer cell lines with ecDNA annotations to 577, which is a 400% increase, covering 31% of cell lines in CCLE/DepMap. We experimentally validate several cell lines that we predict express ecDNA or homogeneous staining regions (HSRs). We demonstrate that CytoCellDB can be used to characterize aneuploidy alongside other molecular phenotypes, (gene essentialities, drug sensitivities, gene expression). We anticipate that CytoCellDB will advance cytogenomics research as well as provide insights into strategies for developing therapeutics that overcome ecDNA-driven drug resistance.">

        <tr id="Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA), an extrachromosomal circular structured DNA, is extensively found in eukaryotes. Exploring eccDNA at the single-cell level contributes to understanding heterogeneity, evolution, development, and specific functions within cells. Nevertheless, the high-throughput identification methods for single-cell eccDNA are complex, and currently mature and widely applicable technologies are lacking. Those factors have led to a scarcity of resources for studying eccDNA at the single-cell level. Therefore, using available single-cell whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, we have constructed a comprehensive eccDNA database named scEccDNAdb (https://lcbb.swjtu.edu.cn/scEccDNAdb/). Presently, scEccDNAdb comprises 3,195,464 single-cell eccDNA entries from both disease/health human and mouse samples, which provides comprehensive annotations including oncogenes, typical enhancers, super-enhancers, CTCF binding sites, SNPs, chromatin accessibility, eQTLs, transcription factor binding sites, motifs, and SVs. Additionally, it provides nine online analysis and visualization tools, facilitating the generation of publication-quality figures for eccDNA analysis through the upload of customized files. Overall, scEccDNAdb represents the first comprehensive database known to us for exploring and analyzing single-cell eccDNA data in diverse cell types, tissues, and species. Graphical abstract">

        <tr id="Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is a form of a circular double-stranded DNA that exists independently of conventional chromosomes. eccDNA exhibits a broad and random distribution across eukaryotic cells and has been associated with tumor-related properties due to its ability to harbor the complete gene information of oncogenes. The complex and multifaceted mechanisms underlying eccDNA formation include pathways such as DNA damage repair, breakage–fusion–bridge (BFB) mechanisms, chromothripsis, and cell apoptosis. Of note, eccDNA plays a pivotal role in tumor development, genetic heterogeneity, and therapeutic resistance. The high copy number and transcriptional activity of oncogenes carried by eccDNA contribute to the accelerated growth of tumors. Notably, the amplification of oncogenes on eccDNA is implicated in the malignant progression of cancer cells. The improvement of high-throughput sequencing techniques has greatly enhanced our knowledge of eccDNA by allowing for a detailed examination of its genetic structures and functions. However, we still lack a comprehensive and efficient annotation for eccDNA, while challenges persist in the study and understanding of the functional role of eccDNA, emphasizing the need for the development of robust methodologies. The potential clinical applications of eccDNA, such as its role as a measurable biomarker or therapeutic target in diseases, particularly within the spectrum of human malignancies, is a promising field for future research. In conclusion, eccDNA represents a quite dynamic and multifunctional genetic entity with far-reaching implications in cancer pathogenesis and beyond. Further research is essential to unravel the molecular pathways of eccDNA formation, elucidate its functional roles, and explore its clinical applications. Addressing these aspects is crucial for advancing our understanding of genomic instability and developing novel strategies for tailored therapeutics, especially in cancer.">

        <tr id="Somatic structural variations (SVs) in cancer can shuffle DNA content in the genome, relocate regulatory elements, and alter genome organization. Enhancer hijacking occurs when SVs relocate distal enhancers to activate proto-oncogenes. However, most enhancer hijacking studies have only focused on protein-coding genes. Here, we develop a computational algorithm 'HYENA' to identify candidate oncogenes (both protein-coding and non-coding) activated by enhancer hijacking based on tumor whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing data. HYENA detects genes whose elevated expression is associated with somatic SVs by using a rank-based regression model. We systematically analyze 1146 tumors across 25 types of adult tumors and identify a total of 108 candidate oncogenes including many non-coding genes. A long non-coding RNA TOB1-AS1 is activated by various types of SVs in 10% of pancreatic cancers through altered 3-dimensional genome structure. We find that high expression of TOB1-AS1 can promote cell invasion and metastasis. Our study highlights the contribution of genetic alterations in non-coding regions to tumorigenesis and tumor progression.">

Yet, organization principles of these multi-interacting enhancer-promoter hubs and their potential role in regulating gene expression in cancer remains unclear. Here, we systematically identified enhancer-promoter hubs in breast cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia. We found that highly interacting enhancer-promoter hubs form at key oncogenes and lineage-associated transcription factors potentially promoting oncogenesis of these diverse cancer types. Genomic and optical mapping of interactions among enhancer and promoter elements further showed that topological alterations in hubs coincide with transcriptional changes underlying acquired resistance to targeted therapy in T cell leukemia and B cell lymphoma. Together, our findings suggest that enhancer-promoter hubs are dynamic and heterogeneous topological assemblies with the potential to control gene expression circuits promoting oncogenesis and drug resistance.">

        <tr id="Human tumors progress in part by accumulating epigenetic alterations, which include gains and losses of DNA methylation in different parts of the cancer cell genome. Recent work has revealed a link between these two opposite alterations by showing that DNA hypomethylation in tumors can induce the expression of transcripts that overlap downstream gene promoters and thereby induce their hypermethylation. Preliminary in silico evidence prompted us to investigate if this mechanism applies to the locus harboring AGO1, a gene that plays a central role in miRNA biogenesis and RNA interference. Inspection of public RNA-Seq datasets and RT-qPCR experiments show that an alternative transcript starting 13.4 kb upstream of AGO1 (AGO1-V2) is expressed specifically in testicular germ cells, and becomes aberrantly activated in different types of tumors, particularly in tumors of the esophagus, stomach, and lung. This expression pattern classifies AGO1-V2 into the group of “Cancer-Germline” (CG) genes. Analysis of transcriptomic and methylomic datasets provided evidence that transcriptional activation of AGO1-V2 depends on DNA demethylation of its promoter region. Western blot experiments revealed that AGO1-V2 encodes a shortened isoform of AGO1, corresponding to a truncation of 75 aa in the N-terminal domain, and which we therefore referred to as “∆NAGO1”. Interestingly, significant correlations between hypomethylation/activation of AGO1-V2 and hypermethylation/repression of AGO1 were observed upon examination of tumor cell lines and tissue datasets. Overall, our study reveals the existence of a process of interdependent epigenetic alterations in the AGO1 locus, which promotes swapping between two AGO1 protein-coding mRNA isoforms in tumors.">

        <tr id="Transcriptional enhancers can regulate individual or multiple genes through long-range three-dimensional (3D) genome interactions, and these interactions are commonly altered in cancer. Yet, the functional relationship between changes in 3D interactions associated with regulatory regions and differential gene expression appears context-dependent. In this study, we used HiChiP to capture changes in 3D genome interactions between active regulatory regions of endometrial cancer cells in response to estrogen treatment and uncovered significant differential long-range interactions that are strongly enriched for estrogen receptor α (ER) bound sites (ERBS). The ERBS anchoring differential loops with either a gene’s promoter or distal regions were correlated with larger transcriptional responses to estrogen compared to ERBS not involved in differential interactions. To functionally test this observation, CRISPR-based Enhancer-i was used to deactivate specific ERBS, which revealed a wide range of effects on the transcriptional response to estrogen. However, these effects are only subtly and not significantly stronger for ERBS in differential loops. In addition, we observed an enrichment of 3D interactions between the promoters of estrogen up-regulated genes and found that looped promoters can work together cooperatively. Overall, our work suggests that changes in 3D genome structure upon estrogen treatment identify some functionally important regulatory regions; however, these changes aren’t required for a transcriptional response to E2 in endometrial cancer cells.">

        <tr id="Although somatic cell genomes are usually entirely clonally inherited, nuclear DNA exchange between cells of an organism can occur sporadically by cell fusion, phagocytosis or other mechanisms1–3. This phenomenon has long been noted in the context of cancer, where it could be envisaged that DNA horizontal transfer plays a functional role in disease evolution4–13. However, an understanding of the frequency and significance of this process in naturally occurring tumours is lacking. The host-tumour genetic discordance of transmissible cancers, malignant clones which pass between animals as allogeneic grafts, provides an opportunity to investigate this. We screened for host-to-tumour horizontal transfer of nuclear DNA in 174 tumours from three transmissible cancers affecting dogs and Tasmanian devils, and detected a single instance in the canine transmissible venereal tumour (CTVT). This involved introduction of a 15-megabase dicentric genetic element, composed of 11 rearranged fragments of six chromosomes, to a CTVT sublineage occurring in Asia around 2,000 years ago. The element forms the short arm of a small submetacentric chromosome, and derives from a dog with ancestry associated with the ancient Middle East. The introduced DNA fragment is transcriptionally active and has adopted the expression profile of CTVT. Its 143 genes do not, however, confer any obvious advantage to its spatially restricted CTVT sublineage. Our findings indicate that nuclear DNA horizontal transfer, although likely a rare event in tumour evolution, provides a viable mechanism for the acquisition of genetic material in naturally occurring cancer genomes.">

Enhancers are regulatory elements that play a major role in transcriptional control and changes in active enhancer function are likely critical in the pathogenesis of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). Here, we utilise STARR-seq to profile the genome-wide enhancer landscape in OAC and identify hundreds of high-confidence enhancer elements. These regions are enriched in enhancer-associated chromatin marks, are actively transcribed and exhibit high levels of associated gene activity in OAC cells. These characteristics are maintained in human patient samples, demonstrating their disease relevance. This relevance is further underlined by their responsiveness to oncogenic ERBB2 inhibition and increased activity compared to the pre-cancerous Barrett’s state. Mechanistically, these enhancers are linked to the core OAC transcriptional network and in particular KLF5 binding is associated with high level activity, providing further support for a role of this transcription factor in defining the OAC transcriptome. Our results therefore uncover a set of enhancer elements with physiological significance, that widen our understanding of the molecular alterations in OAC and point to mechanisms through which response to targeted therapy may occur.">

Targeted Fiber-seq reveals that pathogenic expansions of the DMPK CTG repeat that underlie Myotonic Dystrophy 1 are characterized by somatic instability and disruption of multiple nearby regulatory elements, both of which are repeat length-dependent. Furthermore, we reveal that therapeutic adenine base editing of the segmentally duplicated γ-globin (HBG1/HBG2) promoters in primary human hematopoietic cells induced towards an erythroblast lineage increases the accessibility of the HBG1 promoter as well as neighboring regulatory elements.

Treatment induced substantial (13%) genomic rearrangement that rebounds despite persistent gene expression changes and spreading of acetylation. The chromatin functional landscape (accessibility, active transcription modification, and gene expression) is controlled and locus-specific, while chromatin contacts are globally altered resulting in a moderate weakening of topologically associating domains. Chromatin states are more dynamic at transcriptionally active loci while genes with reduced expression are epigenetically stable suggesting chromatin architectural turnover and nucleosome remodeling is locus-specific and underlies the bidirectional expression changes.

The partial persistence of these altered features may have larger implications for efficacy of epigenetic drugs in amelioration of disease states.">

        <tr id="Whole-genome doubling (WGD) is a critical driver of tumor development and is linked to drug resistance and metastasis in solid malignancies. Here, we demonstrate that WGD is an ongoing mutational process in tumor evolution. Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing, we measured and modeled how WGD events are distributed across cellular populations within tumors and associated WGD dynamics with properties of genome diversification and phenotypic consequences of innate immunity. We studied WGD evolution in 65 high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) tissue samples from 40 patients, yielding 29,481 tumor cell genomes. We found near-ubiquitous evidence of WGD as an ongoing mutational process promoting cell-cell diversity, high rates of chromosomal missegregation, and consequent micronucleation. Using a novel mutation-based WGD timing method, doubleTime, we delineated specific modes by which WGD can drive tumor evolution: (i) unitary evolutionary origin followed by significant diversification, (ii) independent WGD events on a pre-existing background of copy number diversity, and (iii) evolutionarily late clonal expansions of WGD populations. Additionally, through integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that inflammatory signaling and cGAS-STING pathway activation result from ongoing chromosomal instability and are restricted to tumors that remain predominantly diploid. This contrasted with predominantly WGD tumors, which exhibited significant quiescent and immunosuppressive phenotypic states. Together, these findings establish WGD as an evolutionarily ‘active’ mutational process that promotes evolvability and dysregulated immunity in late stage ovarian cancer.">

Here, we couple a CRISPR-based method for ecDNA induction with extensive characterization of newly formed ecDNA to examine their biogenesis. We find that DNA circularization is efficient, irrespective of 3D genome context, with formation of 800kb, 1 Mb, and 1.8 Mb ecDNAs reaching or exceeding 15%. We show non-homologous end joining and microhomology-mediated end joining both contribute to ecDNA formation, while inhibition of DNA-PKcs and ATM have opposing impacts on ecDNA formation. EcDNA and the corresponding chromosomal excision scar can form at significantly different rates and respond differently to DNA-PKcs and ATM inhibition. Taken together, our results support a model of ecDNA formation in which double strand break ends dissociate from their legitimate ligation partners prior to joining of illegitimate ends to form the ecDNA and excision scar.">

        <tr id="Many essential functions of organisms are encoded in highly repetitive genomic regions, including histones involved in DNA packaging, centromeres that are core components of chromosome segregation, ribosomal RNA comprising the protein translation machinery, telomeres that ensure chromosome integrity, piRNA clusters encoding host defenses against selfish elements, and virtually the entire Y chromosome. These regions, formed by highly similar tandem arrays, pose significant challenges for experimental and informatic study, impeding sequence-level descriptions essential for understanding genetic variation. Here, we report the assembly and variation analysis of such repetitive regions in Drosophila melanogaster, offering significant improvements to the existing community reference assembly. Our work successfully recovers previously elusive segments, including complete reconstructions of the histone locus and the pericentric heterochromatin of the X chromosome, spanning the Stellate locus to the distal flank of the rDNA cluster. To infer structural changes in these regions where alignments are often not practicable, we introduce landmark anchors based on unique variants that are putatively orthologous. These regions display considerable structural variation between different D. melanogaster strains, exhibiting differences in copy number and organization of homologous repeat units between haplotypes. In the histone cluster, although we observe minimal genetic exchange indicative of crossing over, the variation patterns suggest mechanisms such as unequal sister chromatid exchange. We also examine the prevalence and scale of concerted evolution in the histone and Stellate clusters and discuss the mechanisms underlying these observed patterns.">

        <tr id="Transcribed enhancer maps can reveal nuclear interactions underpinning each cell type and connect specific cell types to diseases. Using a 5′ single-cell RNA sequencing approach, we defined transcription start sites of enhancer RNAs and other classes of coding and noncoding RNAs in human CD4+ T cells, revealing cellular heterogeneity and differentiation trajectories. Integration of these datasets with single-cell chromatin profiles showed that active enhancers with bidirectional RNA transcription are highly cell type–specific and that disease heritability is strongly enriched in these enhancers. The resulting cell type–resolved multimodal atlas of bidirectionally transcribed enhancers, which we linked with promoters using fine-scale chromatin contact maps, enabled us to systematically interpret genetic variants associated with a range of immune-mediated diseases. Editor’s summary Currently, 3′ single-cell RNA sequencing is widely used as a tool for single-cell gene expression analysis. By leveraging a distinctive “cap signature” derived from the 5′-end cap, Oguchi et al. introduced a technique to investigate the precise position of the RNA 5′-ends in single cells, enabling simultaneous profiling of gene expression and enhancer activity. The authors constructed a CD4+ T cell–type resolved multimodal atlas to integrate and elucidate CD4+ T cell diversity and genetic risk of immune-mediated diseases. They also identified rare, uncharacterized CD4+ T cell types that might contribute to the pathology of immune-mediated diseases. —Di Jiang INTRODUCTION Enhancers are distal cis-regulatory elements that increase the expression of target genes. Active enhancers produce bidirectional enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Transcription of eRNAs can be used to measure enhancer activity and to delineate enhancer architecture at nucleotide resolution. Profiling of transcribed enhancers in single human cells can provide insights into cell type–specific gene regulation and genetic predisposition to diseases. However, comprehensive maps of eRNAs in cell types relevant to diseases are still lacking. RATIONALE The 5′ cap is added to the first nucleotide of an RNA molecule. By leveraging a specific “cap signature,” we developed read-level prefiltering and transcribed enhancer call (ReapTEC), a method for simultaneously profiling gene expression and enhancer activity by using 5′-end single-cell RNA sequencing (5′ scRNA-seq). We applied ReapTEC and single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq) to a total of ~1 million single human CD4+ T cells and constructed a CD4+ T cell type–resolved multimodal atlas to pinpoint genetic and cellular causes of immune-mediated diseases. RESULTS By using ReapTEC, we accurately mapped the transcription start sites of mRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and eRNAs in single cells, which allowed us to study the expression of not only genes but also bidirectionally transcribed candidate enhancers (btcEnhs). We characterized rare and uncharacterized cell types, including GPR25-expressing regulatory T cells, along with the expression profiles of ~130 surface proteins. We identified 62,803 btcEnhs and 218,508 accessible chromatin regions active across diverse CD4+ T cells. We found higher cell type specificity for RNA transcription than for chromatin accessibility both at promoters and enhancers. We also showed that the heritability of immune-mediated diseases was enriched more in btcEnhs than in open chromatin regions. Using our CD4+ T cell type–resolved atlas of btcEnhs, we systematically interpreted genetic variants associated with a range of immune-mediated diseases. We found that btcEnhs harboring disease SNPs were often active in specific subsets of CD4+ T cells; generally, they were conserved across mammals but in some cases were primate specific. We investigated the target genes of disease-relevant btcEnhs by generating fine-scale chromatin contact maps derived from ultradeep Micro-C data; we further performed CRISPR activation of selected disease-relevant btcEnhs to validate their target genes. CONCLUSION Our study establishes a platform for integrating and elucidating CD4+ T cell diversity and genetic risk of immune-mediated diseases. Although 3′ scRNA-seq is widely used as a major tool for single-cell gene expression analysis, our study demonstrates the strength of 5′ scRNA-seq. We anticipate the utility of our multimodal atlas in addressing variant-to-function challenges.

        <tr id="An obligate step in the life cycle of HIV-1 and other retroviruses is the establishment of the provirus in target cell chromosomes. Transcriptional regulation of proviruses is complex, and understanding the mechanisms underlying this regulation has ramifications for fundamental biology, human health, and gene therapy implementation. The three core components of the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex, TASOR, MPHOSPH8 (MPP8), and PPHLN1 (Periphilin 1), were identified in forward genetic screens for host genes that repress provirus expression. Subsequent loss-of-function screens revealed accessory proteins that collaborate with the HUSH complex to silence proviruses in particular contexts. To identify proteins associated with a HUSH complex-repressed provirus in human cells, we developed a technique, Provirus Proximal Proteomics, based on proximity labeling with C-BERST (dCas9-APEX2 biotinylation at genomic elements by restricted spatial tagging). Our screen exploited a lentiviral reporter that is silenced by the HUSH complex in a manner that is independent of the integration site in chromatin. Our data reveal that proviruses silenced by the HUSH complex are associated with DNA repair, mRNA processing, and transcriptional silencing proteins, including L3MBTL2, a member of the non-canonical polycomb repressive complex 1.6 (PRC1.6). A forward genetic screen confirmed that PRC1.6 components L3MBTL2 and MGA contribute to HUSH complex-mediated silencing. PRC1.6 was then shown to silence HUSH-sensitive proviruses in a promoter-specific manner. Genome wide profiling showed striking colocalization of the PRC1.6 and HUSH complexes on chromatin, primarily at sites of active promoters. Finally, PRC1.6 binding at a subset of genes that are silenced by the HUSH complex was dependent on the core HUSH complex component MPP8. These studies offer new tools with great potential for studying the transcriptional regulation of proviruses and reveal crosstalk between the HUSH complex and PRC1.6.">

        <tr id="Abstract Recently, biomolecular condensates formed through liquid–liquid phase separation have been widely reported to regulate key intracellular processes involved in cell biology and pathogenesis. BRD4 is a nuclear protein instrumental to the establishment of phase-separated super-enhancers (SEs) to direct the transcription of important genes. We previously observed that protein droplets of BRD4 became hydrophobic as their size increase, implying an ability of SEs to limit the ionization of water molecules by irradiation. Here, we aim to establish if SEs confer radiation resistance in cancer cells. We established an in vitro DNA damage assay that measures the effect of radicals provoked by the Fenton reaction on DNA integrity. This revealed that DNA damage was markedly reduced when BRD4 underwent phase separation with DNA. Accordingly, co-focal imaging analyses revealed that SE foci and DNA damage foci are mutually exclusive in irradiated cells. Lastly, we observed that the radioresistance of cancer cells was significantly reduced when irradiation was combined with ARV-771, a BRD4 de-stabilizer. Our data revealed the existence of innately radioresistant genomic regions driven by phase separation in cancer cells. The disruption of these phase-separated components enfolding genomic DNA may represent a novel strategy to augment the effects of radiotherapy.">

        <tr id="Interphase mammalian genomes are folded in 3D with complex locus-specific patterns that impact gene regulation. CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is a key architectural protein that binds specific DNA sites, halts cohesin-mediated loop extrusion, and enables long-range chromatin interactions. There are hundreds of thousands of annotated CTCF-binding sites in mammalian genomes; disruptions of some result in distinct phenotypes, while others have no visible effect. Despite their importance, the determinants of which CTCF sites are necessary for genome folding and gene regulation remain unclear. Here, we update and utilize Akita, a convolutional neural network model, to extract the sequence preferences and grammar of CTCF contributing to genome folding. Our analyses of individual CTCF sites reveal four predictions: (i) only a small fraction of genomic sites are impactful, (ii) insulation strength is highly dependent on sequences flanking the core CTCF binding motif, (iii) core and flanking sequences are broadly compatible, and (iv) core and flanking nucleotides contribute largely additively to overall strength. Our analysis of collections of CTCF sites make two predictions for multi-motif grammar: (i) insulation strength depends on the number of CTCF sites within a cluster, and (ii) pattern formation is governed by the orientation and spacing of these sites, rather than any inherent specialization of the CTCF motifs themselves. In sum, we present a framework for using neural network models to probe the sequences instructing genome folding and provide a number of predictions to guide future experimental inquiries. Author Summary Mammalian genomes are spatially organized in 3D with profound consequences for all processes involving DNA. CTCF is a key genome organizer, recognizing numerous sites and creating a variety of contact patterns across the genome. Despite the importance of CTCF, the sequence determinants and grammar of how individual sites collectively instruct genome folding remain unclear. This work leverages the ability of Akita, a deep neural network, to make high-throughput predictions for genome folding after DNA sequence perturbations. Using Akita, we make several experimentally testable predictions. First, only a minority of annotated sites individually impact folding, and flanking DNA sequences greatly modulate their impact. Second, multiple sites together influence folding based on their number, orientation, and spacing. In sum, we provide a roadmap for interpreting neural networks to better understand genome folding and important considerations for the design of experiments.">

        <tr id="We developed a generally applicable method, CRISPR/Cas9-targeted long-read sequencing (CTLR-Seq), to resolve, haplotype-specifically, the large and complex regions in the human genome that had been previously impenetrable to sequencing analysis, such as large segmental duplications (SegDups) and their associated genome rearrangements. CTLR-Seq combines in vitro Cas9-mediated cutting of the genome and pulse-field gel electrophoresis to isolate intact large (i.e., up to 2,000 kb) genomic regions that encompass previously unresolvable genomic sequences. These targets are then sequenced (amplification-free) at high on-target coverage using long-read sequencing, allowing for their complete sequence assembly. We applied CTLR-Seq to the SegDup-mediated rearrangements that constitute the boundaries of, and give rise to, the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS), the most common human microdeletion disorder. We then performed de novo assembly to resolve, at base-pair resolution, the full sequence rearrangements and exact chromosomal breakpoints of 22q11.2DS (including all common subtypes). Across multiple patients, we found a high degree of variability for both the rearranged SegDup sequences and the exact chromosomal breakpoint locations, which coincide with various transposons within the 22q11.2 SegDups, suggesting that 22q11DS can be driven by transposon-mediated genome recombination. Guided by CTLR-Seq results from two 22q11DS patients, we performed three-dimensional chromosomal folding analysis for the 22q11.2 SegDups from patient-derived neurons and astrocytes and found chromosome interactions anchored within the SegDups to be both cell type-specific and patient-specific. Lastly, we demonstrated that CTLR-Seq enables cell-type specific analysis of DNA methylation patterns within the deletion haplotype of 22q11DS.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Isodicentric Y chromosomes are relatively common structural variants of the human genome. The underlying mechanism of isodicentric Y chromosomes with short arm breakpoints [idic(Yq)] remains to be clarified.


CASE PRESENTATION
We encountered a Japanese man with azoospermia and mild short stature. G-banding and array-based comparative genomic hybridization indicated that his karyotype was 45,X/46,X,idic(Y)(qter→p11.32::p11.32→qter) with a ~1.8 Mb terminal deletion. Whole genome sequencing suggested that the Y chromosome had four breakpoints in a ~7 kb region of the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1).


CONCLUSION
This case was assumed to have an idic(Yq) resulting from multiple DNA double-strand breaks in PAR1. This rearrangement may have been facilitated by the PAR1-specific chromatin architecture. The clinical features of the patient can be ascribed to SHOX haploinsufficiency and the presence of a 45,X cell line, although copy-number gains of some Yq genes and the size reduction of PAR1 may also contribute to his spermatogenic failure.">

        <tr id="Chromosomal translocations in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) result in activation of oncogenes by placing them under the regulation of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) super-enhancers. Aberrant expression of translocated oncogenes induced by enhancer activity can contribute to lymphomagenesis. The role of the IGH enhancers in normal B-cell development is well established, but knowledge regarding the precise mechanisms of their involvement in control of the translocated oncogenes is limited. The goal of this project was to define the critical regions in the IGH regulatory elements and identify enhancer RNAs (eRNA). We designed a sgRNA library densely covering the IGH enhancers and performed tiling CRISPR interference screens in three NHL cell lines. This revealed three regions crucial for NHL cell growth. With chromatin-enriched RNA-Seq we showed transcription from the core enhancer regions and subsequently validated expression of the eRNAs in a panel of NHL cell lines and tissue samples. Inhibition of the essential IGH enhancer regions decreased expression of eRNAs and translocated oncogenes in several NHL cell lines. The observed expression and growth patterns were consistent with the breakpoints in the IGH locus. Moreover, targeting the Eμ enhancer resulted in loss of B-cell receptor expression. In a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, MYC overexpression partially rescued the phenotype induced by IGH enhancer inhibition. Our results indicated the most critical regions in the IGH enhancers and provided new insights into the current understanding of the role of IGH enhancers in B-cell NHL. As such, this study forms a basis for development of potential therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Cancer chimeric, or fusion, transcripts are thought to most frequently appear due to chromosomal aberrations that combine moieties of unrelated normal genes. When being expressed, this results in chimeric RNAs having upstream and downstream parts relatively to the breakpoint position for the 5’- and 3’-fusion components, respectively. As many other types of cancer mutations, fusion genes can be of either driver or passenger type. The driver fusions may have pivotal roles in malignisation by regulating survival, growth, and proliferation of tumor cells, whereas the passenger fusions most likely have no specific function in cancer. The majority of research on fusion gene formation events is concentrated on identifying fusion proteins through chimeric transcripts. However, contemporary studies evidence that fusion events involving non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes may also have strong oncogenic potential. In this review we highlight most frequent classes of ncRNAs fusions and summarize current understanding of their functional roles. In many cases, cancer ncRNA fusion can result in altered concentration of the non-coding RNA itself, or it can promote protein expression from the protein-coding fusion moiety. Differential splicing, in turn, can enrich the repertoire of cancer chimeric transcripts, e.g. as observed for the fusions of circular RNAs and long non-coding RNAs. These and other ncRNA fusions are being increasingly recognized as cancer biomarkers and even potential therapeutic targets. Finally, we discuss the use of ncRNA fusion genes in the context of cancer detection and therapy.">

        <tr id="Although the study of leukemogenesis has traditionally focused on protein-coding genes, the role of enhancer dysregulation is becoming increasingly recognized. The advent of high-throughput sequencing, together with a better understanding of enhancer biology, has revealed how various genetic and epigenetic lesions produce oncogenic enhancers that drive transformation. These aberrations include translocations that lead to enhancer hijacking, point mutations that modulate enhancer activity, and copy number alterations that modify enhancer dosage. In this review, we describe these mechanisms in the context of leukemia and discuss potential therapeutic avenues to target these regulatory elements. Significance: Large-scale sequencing projects have uncovered recurrent gene mutations in leukemia, but the picture remains incomplete: some patients harbor no such aberrations, whereas others carry only a few that are insufficient to bring about transformation on their own. One of the missing pieces is enhancer dysfunction, which only recently has emerged as a critical driver of leukemogenesis. Knowledge of the various mechanisms of enhancer dysregulation is thus key for a complete understanding of leukemia and its causes, as well as the development of targeted therapies in the era of precision medicine.">

        <tr id="Purpose: Complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCRs) are rare structural variants involving three or more chromosomal break- points. Most de novo reported CCRs pose challenges for diagnosis and management. They often require karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) for clinical diagnosis because of the limitations of each method. Here we report an inherited exceptionally complex CCR involving 4 chromosomes and 11 breakpoints in a family with multisystem anomalies. Methods: We evaluated the CCRs using karyotyping, FISH, CMA, and two emerging genomic technologies: high-throughput chromosome conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C; aka genomic proximity mapping, GPM) and optical genome mapping (OGM). We also performed functional studies using transcriptome and methylome analyses. Results: The proband, who had intellectual disability and immune deficiency, shared CCRs with her unaffected mother involving chromosomes 1, 7, and 11 by karyotyping. However, CMA revealed a duplication and three deletions in the proband in contrast to her mother's balanced genome. Hi-C (GPM) and OGM detected the CCRs and copy number alterations but also uncovered additional breakpoints at high resolution, including an insertion in 4p and two cryptic rearrangements at 7p. Transcriptome and methylome analyses identified likely biological pathways associated with the proband's phenotypes. Conclusion: Combining cytogenetic and genomic methods provided comprehensive characterization and defined the breakpoints at high resolution in both proband and mother. This underscores the value of novel cytogenetic and genomic techniques in deciphering complex genome rearrangements and the significance of integrative genomic analysis and functional characterization in understanding clinical phenotypes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Aneuploidy, the presence of an aberrant number of chromosomes, has been associated with tumorigenesis for over a century. More recently, advances in karyotyping techniques have revealed its high prevalence in cancer: About 90% of solid tumors and 50–70% of hematopoietic cancers exhibit chromosome gains or losses. When analyzed at the level of specific chromosomes, there are strong patterns that are observed in cancer karyotypes both pan-cancer and for specific cancer types. These specific aneuploidy patterns correlate strongly with outcomes for tumor initiation, progression, metastasis formation, immune evasion and resistance to therapeutic treatment. Despite their prominence, understanding the basis underlying aneuploidy patterns in cancer has been challenging. Advances in genetic engineering and bioinformatic analyses now offer insights into the genetic determinants of aneuploidy pattern selection. Overall, there is substantial evidence that expression changes of particular genes can act as the positive selective forces for adaptation through aneuploidy. Recent findings suggest that multiple genes contribute to the selection of specific aneuploid chromosomes in cancer; however, further research is necessary to identify the most impactful driver genes. Determining the genetic basis and accompanying vulnerabilities of specific aneuploidy patterns is an essential step in selectively targeting these hallmarks of tumors.">

 We sought to identify mechanisms that activate MYC expression in germinal center B cell-(GCB) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) in the absence of MYC rearrangement. High-throughput CRISPR-interference screens in MYC-rearranged (n=4) and non-MYC-rearranged (n=2) GCB-DLBCL cell lines revealed a distal enhancer complex 436 kb downstream of MYC, GME-1, that was uniquely essential in non-rearranged (MYC-intact) cell lines. CRISPR-interference studies confirmed growth inhibition and MYC downregulation upon GME-1 repression in 4 DLBCL cell lines. ChIP-Seq showed that GME-1 subunits were bound by OCT2, OCA-B, and MEF2B, which are known to activate germinal center-specific enhancers, and knockdown of the corresponding genes reduced MYC expression. GME-1 subunits showed GCB-specific acetylation and accessibility across normal human B cell populations in public chromatin datasets. The mouse ortholog of GME-1 showed germinal center B cell-specific accessibility. GME-1 was strongly acetylated in MYC-intact but not MYC-rearranged GCB-DLBCL cell lines and patient biopsies. Hi-C revealed significant looping of GME-1 to the MYC promoter in MYC protein+, MYC-intact DLBCL biopsies (n=2), but not MYC-rearranged DLBCL (n=2). We used sequence conservation and chromatin accessibility data to define four GME-1 subunits (195A/B and196A/B), which were cloned into luciferase enhancer reporter constructs and compared to two subunits of the BCL6 distal super-enhancer complex that had previously been identified as regulated by the OCT2/OCA-B/MEF2B complex. GME-1 subunit 195B was the only strongly transcription-activating element based on luciferase assays across three MYC-intact cells lines, where it showed activity comparable to BCL6 enhancers. In contrast, GME-1 enhancers were minimally active in reporter assays performed in two MYC-rearranged GCB-DLBCL cell lines. Deletion of a conserved OCT2 binding site or knockdown of the POU2F2 and POU2AF1 genes reduced activity of GME-1. Thus GME-1 trans-regulation is divergent from that of previously characterized GCB enhancers, despite shared dependency on the OCT2 ternary complex. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed that the GME-1 dependent cell line SUDHL5 bears a 176bp tandem duplication within GME-1 195B. This altered enhancer showed stronger luciferase reporter activity across three MYC-intact cell lines. Published WGS datasets showed isolated genomic tandem copy gains of GME-1 in 2/49 biopsies from recurrent/refractory DLBCL and 1/93 unselected DLBCL. In a cohort of 18 DLBCL with the high-risk DZSig gene expression signature, GME-1 amplification was seen in two biopsies with concurrent deletion of the PVT1 promoter (PVT1-P) and no inter-chromosomal MYC locus rearrangement. CRISPRi showed that PVT1-P repression reduced growth and MYC expression in GME-1-dependent DLBCL, but not in cell lines where rearrangements removed PVT-P from its position in cis with the MYC gene. Our findings identify GME-1 as an activator of MYC expression and target of rare but recurrent genomic copy gains in high-risk DLBCL.

        <tr id="While genome-wide association studies and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis have made significant progress in identifying noncoding variants associated with prostate cancer risk and bulk tissue transcriptome changes, the regulatory effect of these genetic elements on gene expression remains largely unknown. Recent developments in single-cell sequencing have made it possible to perform ATAC-seq and RNA-seq profiling simultaneously to capture functional associations between chromatin accessibility and gene expression. In this study, we tested our hypothesis that this multiome single-cell approach allows for mapping regulatory elements and their target genes at prostate cancer risk loci. We applied a 10X Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression platform to encapsulate Tn5 transposase-tagged nuclei from multiple prostate cell lines for a total of 65,501 high quality single cells from RWPE1, RWPE2, PrEC, BPH1, DU145, PC3, 22Rv1 and LNCaP cell lines. To address data sparsity commonly seen in the single-cell sequencing, we performed targeted sequencing to enrich sequencing data at prostate cancer risk loci involving 2,730 candidate germline variants and 273 associated genes. Although not increasing the number of captured cells, the targeted multiome data did improve eQTL gene expression abundance by about 20% and chromatin accessibility abundance by about 5%. Based on this multiomic profiling, we further associated RNA expression alterations with chromatin accessibility of germline variants at single cell levels. Cross validation analysis showed high overlaps between the multiome associations and the bulk eQTL findings from GTEx prostate cohort. We found that about 20% of GTEx eQTLs were covered within the significant multiome associations (p-value ≤ 0.05, gene abundance percentage ≥ 5%), and roughly 10% of the multiome associations could be identified by significant GTEx eQTLs. We also analyzed accessible regions with available heterozygous SNP reads and observed more frequent association in genomic regions with allelically accessible variants (p = 0.0055). Among these findings were previously reported regulatory variants including rs60464856-RUVBL1 (multiome p-value = 0.0099 in BPH1) and rs7247241-SPINT2 (multiome p-value = 0.0002- 0.0004 in 22Rv1). We also functionally validated a new regulatory SNP and its target gene rs2474694-VPS53 (multiome p-value = 0.00956 in BPH1 and 0.00625 in DU145) by reporter assay and SILAC proteomics sequencing. Taken together, our data demonstrated the feasibility of the multiome single-cell approach for identifying regulatory SNPs and their regulated genes.">

        <tr id="Male sex chromosome aneuploidies are frequent genetic aberrations in humans characterized by additional Y or X chromosome complements. Jacob (JS) and Klinefelter syndromes (KS), carrying 47,XYY and 47,XXY chromosomes, respectively, share several clinical features, including sterility, hormonal deficits, neurocognitive delay, and skeletal-muscle defects. Despite the high incidence, a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations in sex aneuploid patients is still elusive. In this study, we generated and characterized the inaugural cohort of 47,XYY human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We performed a comprehensive transcriptional analysis, including JS primary fibroblasts, iPSCs, and neural stem cells (NSCs) alongside KS cells. Our study revealed a transcriptional feedback mechanism tuning non-PAR X chromosome genes (NPX) homologs in Y supernumerary cells, a phenomenon not detected in X aneuploid iPSCs. By ectopically modulating the expression of selected NPY genes, we demonstrated a direct transcriptional link between the UTY-UTX gene pair. Furthermore, our analyses identified a shared transcriptomic signature between JS and KS, discernible already at the iPSC stage, with a notable enrichment for processes related to neurological functions. This transcriptomic convergence underscores potential commonalities in the molecular pathways underpinning the pathophysiology of male sex chromosome aneuploidies. Finally, through genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of JS iPSCs, we demonstrated that a supernumerary Y chromosome only minimally impacts the methylation status of 47,XYY cells at the pluripotent stage. Our work reveals critical transcriptional feedback mechanisms and shared gene expression signatures in male sex chromosome aneuploidies, paving the way for a better understanding of their common phenotypic features.">

It is established that CNAs disturb the dosage of genomic regions including enhancers/promoters, long non-coding RNA and gene(s) among others, ultimately leading to an altered balance of key cellular functions. In cancer, CNAs have been associated with almost all steps of the disease: predisposition, initiation, development, maintenance, response to treatment, resistance, and relapse. Therefore, understanding how specific CNAs contribute to tumourigenesis may provide prognostic insight and ultimately lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes. In this review, we provide a snapshot of what is currently known about CNAs and cancer, incorporating topics regarding their detection, clinical impact, origin, and nature, and discuss the integration of innovative genetic engineering strategies, to highlight the potential for targeting CNAs using novel, dosage-sensitive and less toxic therapies for CNA-driven cancer.">

        <tr id="Recurrent mutations in serine / arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2), particularly the proline-to-histidine substitution at position 95 (P95H), have been proposed to drive neoplastic diseases. SRSF2 plays pivotal roles in pre-mRNA processing and gene transcription. However, the precise impact of these diverse functions of SRSF2 on cancer cell behaviour remains unclear. Here, we show that deletion or homozygous P95H mutation of SRSF2 both cause extensive DNA damage leading to cell cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo, regardless of cell genotype. We mechanistically demonstrate that SRSF2 is required for efficient bi-directional transcription of DNA replication and repair genes, independent of its function in splicing. In contrast, SRSF2 haploinsufficiency induces DNA damage without halting the cell cycle in cancer cells. Inducing the heterozygous Srsf2 P95H mutation leads to clonal expansion of epidermal cells in mouse skin, but tumor formation is inhibited following exposure to carcinogens. To survive carcinogen treatment, cells containing the Srsf2 P95H mutation undergo substantial transcription rewiring that restores bi-directional gene expression. Thus, our study reveals crucial roles of SRSF2 beyond splicing and underscores its importance in regulating transcription to orchestrate the cell cycle along with the DNA damage response.">

To understand the functional genomic roles of DNA modifications, it is critical to accurately map their diverse chemical forms with single-nucleotide precision in complex genomes, but it remains challenging. Click-code-seq is a click-chemistry-aided single-nucleotide-resolution strategy for guanine-oxidation mapping, used in yeast DNA but having poor applicability to human genomes. Here, we upgraded click-code-seq to enable its first application for sequencing DNA oxidation and depurination in human genomes. For this, we developed a companion fluorescence assay, click-fluoro-quant, to rapidly quantify different common DNA modifications, and devised novel adapters to minimize false modification detection and assess modification frequency in cell populations. We uncovered that endogenous DNA oxidation in a human cell line has a highly similar pattern to cancer mutational signatures associated with reactive oxygen species. We established that the DNA-alkylating chemotherapy drug irofulven preferentially induces depurination in ApA dimers and promoter regions. Intriguingly, we revealed that oxidized guanines and apurinic sites, both irofulven-induced and endogenous, are depleted in gene transcribed strands, and the strand bias widens with increasing gene expression. This work substantially advances click-code-seq for deciphering the impacts of key modifications in human DNA on cellular physiology and toxicological responses.">

        <tr id="Animal chromosomes can persist with recognizable homology over hundreds of millions of years, in spite of homology-obfuscating processes such as chromosomal fusion and translocation. The frequency and pace of these major genome structural changes are unknown, and it remains unclear whether or how they impact long-term genome evolution. Here, we compare whole chromosomal sequences of 3,631 genomes from 2,291 species spanning all major animal clades and show that animal karyotypes evolve primarily via karyotype contraction, associated with increased rates of chromosomal fusion-with-mixing and dispersion that largely obey chromosomal algebra1, or karyotype expansion, which breaks up ancestral linkage groups and forms new chromosomal elements via non-algebraic changes. We show that chromosomal changes can be associated with major extinction events. Using a multi-scale encoding of pan-animal genome homology and a manifold representation of genomic changes, we find that genome evolution is not only driven by changes at the chromosomal level, but that subchromosomal mixing and irreversibility define clade-specific evolution. Using this ‘evolutionary genome topology’ approach, we calculate extrema of irreversible genomic configurations and identify species that occupy intermediate manifold positions, providing evidence for distinct macro-evolutionary trajectories. We propose that investigation of mixed state accumulation around important gene loci (such as Hox) will be crucial in capturing and further study of clade-specific regulatory innovations.">

        <tr id="The most significant genetic influence on eye color pigmentation is attributed to the intronic SNP rs12913832 in the HERC2 gene, which interacts with the promoter region of the contiguous OCA2 gene. This interaction, through the formation of a chromatin loop, modulates the transcriptional activity of OCA2, directly affecting eye color pigmentation. Recent advancements in technology have elucidated the precise spatial organization of the genome within the cell nucleus, with chromatin architecture playing a pivotal role in regulating various genome functions. In this study, we investigated the organization of the chromatin close to the HERC2/OCA2 locus in human lymphocyte nuclei using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. The 3 Mb of genomic DNA that belonged to the chromosomal region 15q12-q13.1 revealed the presence of three contiguous chromatin loops, which exhibited a different level of compaction depending on the presence of the A or G allele in the SNP rs12913832. Moreover, the analysis of the genomic organization of the genes has demonstrated that this chromosomal region is evolutionarily highly conserved, as evidenced by the analysis of syntenic regions in species from other Vertebrate classes. Thus, the role of rs12913832 variant is relevant not only in determining the transcriptional activation of the OCA2 gene but also in the chromatin compaction of a larger region, underscoring the critical role of chromatin organization in the proper regulation of the involved genes. It is crucial to consider the broader implications of this finding, especially regarding the potential regulatory role of similar polymorphisms located within intronic regions, which do not influence the same gene by modulating the splicing process, but they regulate the expression of adjacent genes. Therefore, caution should be exercised when utilizing whole-exome sequencing for diagnostic purposes, as intron sequences may provide valuable gene regulation information on the region where they reside. Thus, future research efforts should also be directed towards gaining a deeper understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying the role and mode of action of intronic SNPs in chromatin loop organization and transcriptional regulation.">

        <tr id="Background and Aim: Canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT), a unique transmissible cancer in dogs, affects the external genitalia and potentially spreads to other parts of the body. While somatic mutations in oncogenic and tumor-suppressing genes are linked to CTVT development, the impact of DNA methylation, which affects gene expression, remains unclear. This study explored whether DNA methylation in the promoter regions of the MYC oncogene and CDKN2B tumor suppressor genes in CTVTs is associated with their expression, both at the gene and protein levels. 

Materials and Methods: To investigate promoter DNA methylation of MYC and CDKN2B in CTVTs, we analyzed frozen tissue samples from genital CTVT (GTVTs) and extragenital CTVT (ETVTs). Genomic DNA was extracted, bisulfite-treated, and analyzed using bisulfite polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The messenger RNA and protein of MYC and CDKN2B were also extracted and assessed by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Matching formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks were used for immunohistochemical staining to visualize protein distribution in GTVT and ETVT tissues. 

Results: Although both GTVT and ETVT samples showed MYC promoter methylation, the extent of methylation differed significantly. GTVTs displayed a much higher degree of methylation, potentially explaining the more pronounced downregulation of MYC gene expression and reduction in c-MYC protein levels observed in GTVTs compared with ETVTs. Our data revealed a prevalent hypermethylation pattern in the CDKN2B promoter across both sample types. However, DNA methylation, which was expected to have a suppressive effect, did not correlate with gene/protein expression. GTVTs displayed high protein levels despite significantly reduced CDKN2B expression. Conversely, ETVTs maintained regular CDKN2B expression but exhibited reduced protein production, suggesting a complex interplay between methylation and expression in these tumors. 

Conclusion: MYC demonstrated a clear association between its promoter methylation status, gene expression, and protein levels; however, CDKN2B lacked this correlation, implying the involvement of methylation-independent regulatory mechanisms and highlighting the need for further investigation.

We refined the mutational landscape of pancreatic cancer by capturing events missed by bulk sequencing, and validated the evolution pattern of early fixation of driver single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) followed by generation of intratumoral heterogeneity for copy number variations (CNVs). Intertumoral convergent evolution was common, including subclonal inactivation of TGF-β pathway by mutating various components of it; intratumoral convergence was rarely observed, likely due to strong selective force in pancreatic cancer development. Continuous evolution was frequently seen manifesting as CNVs. In the context of non-targeted treatments, no particular pattern was found across metastases or through treatment. In six pancreatic cancers with germline BRCA2 mutation, we discovered varied timing of biallelic inactivation of BRCA2, which sculpted different evolutionary trajectories and could presumably contribute to differential response to treatment. As the first large-scale application of targeted snDNA-seq on pancreatic cancer, this work provides a sample processing and computational analysis pipeline that warrants further clinical utility.">

Although gene expression regulation can occur at transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels, transcription initiation is the first and the most important step in gene expression, facilitating the transfer of biological information from DNA to protein. Enhancers and super-enhancers are among the master regulators of tissue- and cell-specific transcription regulation involved in cell differentiation and tumor formation. Despite four decades passing since the first discovery of enhancers in eukaryotes and extensive efforts undertaken to identify enhancers on a genomic scale during the last decade, the discovery of enhancers still faces certain limitations and needs further investigation. The perturbation of enhancer function due to genetic or epigenetic changes is closely linked to a range of human disorders, including the development and progression of cancers. Thus, the detection of early cancer-related enhancer activity and the subsequent normalization of expression abnormalities using enhancer-targeting CRISPR epigenetic editing, as well as enhancer-targeting pharmaceuticals, are regarded as groundbreaking therapeutic tactics in preclinical stages.">

        <tr id="The mammalian mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is multicopy and its copy number (mtCN) varies widely across tissues, in development and in disease. Here, we systematically catalog this variation by assaying mtCN in 52 human tissues across 952 donors (10,499 samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project) and 20 murine tissues using qPCR, capturing 50- and 200-fold variation, respectively. We also estimate per cell mtCN across 173 human cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia using whole-genome sequencing data and observe >50-fold variation. We then leverage the vast amount of genomics data available for these repositories to credential our resource and uncover mtDNA-related biology. Using already existing proteomics data, we show that variation in mtCN can be predicted by variation in TFAM, histone, and mitochondrial ribosome protein abundance. We also integrate mtCN estimates with the CRISPR gene dependency measurements to find that cell lines with high mtCN are resistant to loss of GPX4, a glutathione phospholipid hydroperoxidase. Our resource captures variation in mtCN across mammalian tissues and should be broadly useful to the research community.">

        <tr id="We describe exciting recent advances in fusion-driven sarcoma etiology, from an epigenetics perspective. By exploring the current state of the field, we identify and describe the central mechanisms that determine sarcomagenesis. Further, we discuss seminal studies in translational genomics, which enabled epigenetic characterization of fusion-driven sarcomas. Important context for epigenetic mechanisms include, but are not limited to, cell cycle and metabolism, core regulatory circuitry, 3-dimensional chromatin architectural dysregulation, integration with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, and translational animal modeling. Paradoxically, while the genetic requirements for oncogenic transformation are highly specific for the fusion partners, the epigenetic mechanisms we as a community have uncovered are categorically very broad. This dichotomy prompts the question of whether the investigation of rare disease epigenomics should prioritize studying individual cell populations, thereby examining whether the mechanisms of chromatin dysregulation are specific to a particular tumor. We review recent advances focusing on rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, undifferentiated round cell sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, myxoid/round liposarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and desmoplastic round cell tumor. The growing number of groundbreaking discoveries in the field, motivated us to anticipate further exciting advances in the area of mechanistic epigenomics and direct targeting of fusion transcription factors in the years ahead.">

        <tr id="Background: Intermediate cell carcinoma (Int-CA) is a rare and enigmatic primary liver cancer characterized by uniform tumor cells exhibiting mixed features of both HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Despite the unique pathological features of int-CA, its molecular characteristics remain unclear yet. Methods: RNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing profiling were performed on int-CA tumors and compared with those of HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Results: Int-CAs unveiled a distinct and intermediate transcriptomic feature that is strikingly different from both HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The marked abundance of splicing events leading to intron retention emerged as a signature feature of int-CA, along with a prominent expression of Notch signaling. Further exploration revealed that METTL16 was suppressed within int-CA, showing a DNA copy number–dependent transcriptional deregulation. Notably, experimental investigations confirmed that METTL16 suppression facilitated invasive tumor characteristics through the activation of the Notch signaling cascade. Conclusions: Our results provide a molecular landscape of int-CA featured by METTL16 suppression and frequent intron retention events, which may play pivotal roles in the acquisition of the aggressive phenotype of Int-CA.">

        <tr id="The expression of eukaryotic genes relies on the precise 3’-terminal cleavage and polyadenylation of newly synthesized pre-mRNA transcripts. Defects in these processes have been associated with various diseases, including cancer. While cancer-focused sequencing studies have identified numerous driver mutations in protein-coding sequences, noncoding drivers – particularly those affecting the cis-elements required for pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation – have received less attention. Here, we systematically analysed cancer somatic mutations affecting 3’UTR polyadenylation signals using the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) dataset. We found a striking enrichment of cancer-specific somatic mutations that disrupt strong and evolutionarily conserved cleavage and polyadenylation signals within tumour suppressor genes. Further bioinformatics and experimental analyses conducted as a part of our study suggest that these mutations have a profound capacity to downregulate the expression of tumour suppressor genes. Thus, this work uncovers a novel class of noncoding somatic mutations with significant potential to drive cancer progression.">

        <tr id="The myeloma overexpressed gene (MYEOV) has been proposed to be a proto-oncogene due to high RNA transcript levels found in multiple cancers, including myeloma, breast, lung, pancreas and esophageal cancer. The presence of an open reading frame (ORF) in humans and other primates suggests protein-coding potential. Yet, we still lack evidence of a functional MYEOV protein. It remains undetermined how MYEOV overexpression affects cancerous tissues. In this work, we show that MYEOV has likely originated and may still function as an enhancer, regulating CCND1 and LTO1. Firstly, MYEOV 3′ enhancer activity was confirmed in humans using publicly available ATAC-STARR-seq data, performed on B-cell-derived GM12878 cells. We detected enhancer histone marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac overlapping MYEOV in multiple healthy human tissues, which include B cells, liver and lung tissue. The analysis of 3D genome datasets revealed chromatin interactions between a MYEOV-3′-putative enhancer and the proto-oncogene CCND1. BLAST searches and multi-sequence alignment results showed that DNA sequence from this human enhancer element is conserved from the amphibians/amniotes divergence, with a 273 bp conserved region also found in all mammals, and even in chickens, where it is consistently located near the corresponding CCND1 orthologues. Furthermore, we observed conservation of an active enhancer state in the MYEOV orthologues of four non-human primates, dogs, rats, and mice. When studying this homologous region in mice, where the ORF of MYEOV is absent, we not only observed an enhancer chromatin state but also found interactions between the mouse enhancer homolog and Ccnd1 using 3D-genome interaction data. This is similar to the interaction observed in humans and, interestingly, coincides with CTCF binding sites in both species. Taken together, this suggests that MYEOV is a primate-specific gene with a de novo ORF that originated at an evolutionarily older enhancer region. This deeply conserved putative enhancer element could regulate CCND1 in both humans and mice, opening the possibility of studying MYEOV regulatory functions in cancer using non-primate animal models.">

        <tr id="The relevant role of LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition in cancer has been recurrently demonstrated in recent years. However, their repetitive nature hampers their identification and detection, hence remaining inaccessible for clinical practice. Also, its clinical relevance for cancer patients is still limited. Here, we develop a new method to quantify L1 activation, called RetroTest, based on targeted sequencing and a sophisticated bioinformatic pipeline, allowing its application in tumor biopsies. First, we performed the benchmarking of the method and confirmed its high specificity and reliability. Then, we unravel the L1 activation in HNSCC according to a more extensive cohort including all the HNSCC tumor stages. Our results confirm that RetroTest is remarkably efficient for L1 detection in tumor biopsies, reaching a high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, L1 retrotransposition estimation reveals a surprisingly early activation in HNSCC progression, contrary to its classical association with advanced tumor stages. This early activation together with the genomic mutational profiling of normal adjacent tissues supports field cancerization process in this tumor. These results underline the importance of estimating L1 retrotransposition in clinical practice towards an earlier and more efficient diagnosis in HNSCC.">

        <tr id="Summary From RNA interference to chromatin silencing, diverse genome defense pathways silence selfish genetic elements to safeguard genome integrity1,2. Despite their diversity, different defense pathways share a modular organization, where numerous specificity factors identify diverse targets and common effectors silence them. In the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, which controls selfish elements in the metazoan germline, diverse target RNAs are first identified by complementary base pairing with piRNAs and then silenced by PIWI-clade nucleases via enzymatic cleavage1,3. Such a binary architecture allows the defense systems to be readily adaptable, where new targets can be captured via the innovation of new specificity factors4,5. Thus, our current understanding of genome defense against lineage-specific selfish genes has been largely limited to the evolution of specificity factors, while it remains poorly understood whether other types of innovations are required. Here, we describe a new type of innovation, which escalates the defense capacity of the piRNA pathway to control a recently expanded selfish gene in Drosophila melanogaster. Through an in vivo RNAi screen for repressors of Stellate—a recently evolved and expanded selfish meiotic driver6–8—we discovered a novel defense factor, Trailblazer. Trailblazer is a transcription factor that promotes the expression of two PIWI-clade nucleases, Aub and AGO3, to match Stellate in abundance. Recent innovation in the DNA-binding domain of Trailblazer enabled it to drastically elevate Aub and AGO3 expression in the D. melanogaster lineage, thereby escalating the silencing capacity of the piRNA pathway to control expanded Stellate and safeguard fertility. As copy-number expansion is a recurrent feature of diverse selfish genes across the tree of life9–12, we envision that augmenting the defense capacity to quantitatively match selfish genes is likely a repeatedly employed defense strategy in evolution.">

        <tr id="DNA methylation is a key epigenetic regulatory mechanism that plays a critical role in a variety of cellular processes, including the regulation of cell fate during development, maintenance of cell identity, and genome stability. DNA methylation is tightly regulated by enzymatic reactions and its deregulation plays an important role in the development of cancer. Specific DNA methylation alterations have been found in pediatric solid tumors, providing new insights into the development of these tumors. In addition, DNA methylation profiles have greatly contributed to tune the diagnosis of pediatric solid tumors and to define subgroups of patients with different risks of progression, leading to the reduction in unwanted toxicity and the improvement of treatment efficacy. This review highlights the dysregulated DNA methylome in pediatric solid tumors and how this information provides promising targets for epigenetic therapies, particularly inhibitors of DNMT enzymes (DNMTis). Opportunities and limitations are considered, including the ability of DNMTis to induce viral mimicry and immune signaling by tumors. Besides intrinsic action against cancer cells, DNMTis have the potential to sensitize immune-cold tumors to immunotherapies and may represent a remarkable option to improve the treatment of challenging pediatric solid tumors.">

        <tr id="During the sexual cycle, programmed genome rearrangement (PGR) in Paramecium tetraurelia involves the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway to eliminate specific germinal Internal Eliminated Sequences (IESs) from the newly developing somatic nucleus. In addition to the core NHEJ factors Ku70/80 and Xrcc4/Lig4, additional enzymes are required to process the 4-base 5’-protruding ends generated following DNA cleavage at IES boundaries, prior to their ligation. Here, we report that PolX (a,b,c,d), four P. tetraurelia distant orthologs of the human Polλ DNA polymerase, are involved in repair of IES excision junctions. During rearrangements, PolX-depleted cells accumulate genome-wide errors, such as unrepaired double-strand breaks, 1-nucleotide deletions and IES retention. Although all PolX paralogs can process DNA ends, two of them (PolXa&b) are induced during PGR and have acquired tight nuclear anchoring properties through their N-terminal region, which contains a predicted BRCT domain. Finally, we show that PolXa accumulates in nuclear foci together with other NHEJ proteins and the Dicer-like enzyme Dcl5, which is involved in the biogenesis of IES-specific small RNAs. We propose that these “DNA repair foci” correspond to the sites where IES concatemers, a by-product of IES excision, are ligated together to produce the precursors of iesRNAs.">

        <tr id="DNA, is assaulted by endogenous and exogenous agents that lead to the formation of damage. In order to maintain genome integrity DNA repair pathways must be efficiently activated to prevent mutations and deleterious chromosomal rearrangements. Conversely, genome flexibility is also necessary to allow genetic diversity and evolution. The antagonist interaction between maintenance of genome integrity and flexibility determines genome shape and organization. Therefore, it is of great interest to understand how the whole linear genome structure behaves upon formation and repair of DNA damage. For this, we used long reads sequencing technology to identify and to characterize genomic structural variations (SV) of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana somatic cells exposed either to UV-B, to UV-C or to protons irradiations. We found that genomic regions located in heterochromatin a more prone to form SVs than those located in euchromatin, highlighting that genome stability and flexibility differs along the chromosome. This holds true in Arabidopsis plants deficient for the expression of master regulators of the DNA Damage Response (DDR), ATM and ATR, suggesting that independent and alternative surveillance processes exist to maintain integrity in genic regions. Finally, the analysis of the radiations-induced deleted regions allowed determining that exposure UV-B, UV-C and protons induced the Microhomology-mediated end joining mechanism (MMEJ) and that both ATM and ATR repress this repair pathway.">

        <tr id="With age, hematopoietic stem cells can acquire somatic mutations in leukemogenic genes that confer a proliferative advantage in a phenomenon termed “clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential” (CHIP). How these mutations confer a proliferative advantage and result in increased risk for numerous age-related diseases remains poorly understood. We conducted a multiracial meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of CHIP and its subtypes in four cohorts (N=8196) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CHIP and illuminate how these changes influence cardiovascular disease risk. The EWAS findings were functionally validated using human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) models of CHIP. A total of 9615 CpGs were associated with any CHIP, 5990 with DNMT3A CHIP, 5633 with TET2 CHIP, and 6078 with ASXL1 CHIP (P <1×10−7). CpGs associated with CHIP subtypes overlapped moderately, and the genome-wide DNA methylation directions of effect were opposite for TET2 and DNMT3A CHIP, consistent with their opposing effects on global DNA methylation. There was high directional concordance between the CpGs shared from the meta-EWAS and human edited CHIP HSCs. Expression quantitative trait methylation analysis further identified transcriptomic changes associated with CHIP-associated CpGs. Causal inference analyses revealed 261 CHIP-associated CpGs associated with cardiovascular traits and all-cause mortality (FDR adjusted p-value <0.05). Taken together, our study sheds light on the epigenetic changes impacted by CHIP and their associations with age-related disease outcomes. The novel genes and pathways linked to the epigenetic features of CHIP may serve as therapeutic targets for preventing or treating CHIP-mediated diseases.">

        <tr id="Repairing programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is crucial in the lifecycle of Paramecium tetraurelia, especially during its sexual reproduction phase when its somatic highly polyploid macronucleus is lost. The formation of a new macronucleus involves Programmed Genome Rearrangements, introducing DNA DSBs at approximately 45,000 loci. P. tetraurelia employs a Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)-related mechanism for the systematic repair of these DSBs. Four genes encoding DNA polymerases of family X are present in the genome, one of which was found recently to colocalize with other proteins of NHEJ. The question arises as to how they make almost no error. Here we show that these enzymes are most similar to metazoan DNA polymerase λ and exhibit high fidelity through two different molecular mechanisms. Using X-ray structure determination of polymerase lambda mutants recapitulating sequence determinants of P. tetraurelia PolXs, we find both a local conformational change that involves exchanging partners in a crucial salt bridge in the active site upon binding of correct dNTPs, and a larger conformational change involving the closure of Loop3. This stabilizes the template DNA in the active site, only in the presence of the correct incoming dNTP. Differences with human pol λ and pol β are discussed. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT">

        <tr id="The male mammalian germline is characterized by substantial chromatin remodeling associated with the transition from histones to protamines during spermatogenesis, followed by the reversal to nucleohistones in the male pronucleus preceding the zygotic genome activation. Both transitions are associated with the extensive formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), requiring an estimated 5 to 10 million transient DSBs per spermatozoa. Additionally, the high transcription rate in early stages of spermatogenesis leads to transcription-coupled damage preceding meiotic homologous recombination, potentially further contributing to the DSB landscape in mature spermatozoa. Once meiosis is completed, spermatozoa remain haploid and therefore cannot rely on error-free homologous recombination, but instead depend on error-prone classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ). This DNA damage/repair-scenario is proposed to be one of the main causes of the observed paternal mutation propensity in human evolution. Recent studies have shown that DSBs in the male pronucleus are repaired by maternally provided Polθ in Caenorhabditis elegans through Polθ-mediated end joining (TMEJ). Additionally, population genetic datasets have revealed a preponderance of TMEJ signatures associated with human variation. Since these signatures are the result of the combined effect of TMEJ and DSB formation in spermatozoa and male pronuclei, we used a BLISS-based protocol to analyze recurrent DSBs in mature human sperm heads as a proxy of the male pronucleus before zygotic chromatin remodeling. The DSBs were found to be enriched in (YR)n short tandem repeats and in evolutionarily young SINEs, reminiscent to patterns observed in murine spermatids, indicating evolutionary hotspots of recurrent DSB formation in mammalian spermatozoa. Additionally, we detected a similar DSB pattern in diploid human IMR90 cells when cNHEJ was selectively inhibited, indicating the significant impact of absent cNHEJ on the sperm DSB landscape. Strikingly, regions associated with most retained histones, and therefore less condensed chromatin, were not strongly enriched with recurrent DSBs. In contrast, the fraction of retained H3K27me3 in the mature spermatozoa displayed a strong association with recurrent DSBs. DSBs in H3K27me3 are associated with a preference for TMEJ over cNHEJ during repair. We hypothesize that the retained H3K27me3 may trigger transgenerational DNA repair by priming maternal Polθ to these regions.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have long been postulated as an important source cell in regenerative medicine. During subculture expansion, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) senescence diminishes their multi-differentiation capabilities, leading to a loss of therapeutic potential. Up to date, the extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) have been demonstrated to be involved in senescence but the roles of eccDNAs during MSC.Here we explored eccDNA profiles in human bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs). EccDNA and mRNA was purified and sequenced, followed by quantification and functional annotation. Moreover, we mapped our datasets with the downloading enhancer and transcription factor-regulated genes to explore the potential role of eccDNAs.Sequentially, gene annotation analysis revealed that the majority of eccDNA were mapped in the intron regions with limited BM-MSC enhancer overlaps. We discovered that these eccDNA motifs in senescent BMSCs acted as motifs for binding transcription factors (TFs) of senescence-related genes.These findings are highly significant for identifying biomarkers of senescence and therapeutic targets in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for future clinical applications. The potential of eccDNA as a stable therapeutic target for senescence-related disorders warrants further investigation, particularly exploring chemically synthesized eccDNAs as transcription factor regulatory elements to reverse cellular senescence.">

        <tr id="Deficiencies in DNA mismatch repair (MMRd) leave characteristic footprints of microsatellite instability (MSI) in cancer genomes. We used data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium to conduct a comprehensive analysis of MSI-associated cancers, focusing on indel mutational signatures. We classified MSI-high genomes into two subtypes based on their indel profiles: deletion-dominant (MMRd-del) and insertion-dominant (MMRd-ins). Compared with MMRd-del genomes, MMRd-ins genomes exhibit distinct mutational and transcriptomic features, including a higher prevalence of T>C substitutions and related mutation signatures. Short insertions and deletions in MMRd-ins and MMRd-del genomes target different sets of genes, resulting in distinct indel profiles between the two subtypes. In addition, indels in the MMRd-ins genomes are enriched with subclonal alterations that provide clues about a distinct evolutionary relationship between the MMRd-ins and MMRd-del genomes. Notably, the transcriptome analysis indicated that MMRd-ins cancers upregulate immune-related genes, show a high level of immune cell infiltration, and display an elevated neoantigen burden. The genomic and transcriptomic distinctions between the two types of MMRd genomes highlight the heterogeneity of genetic mechanisms and resulting genomic footprints and transcriptomic changes in cancers, which has potential clinical implications.">

We show that cells exposed to a low dose of therapy adapt to become resistant to a high dose, demonstrating that resistance was not purely selective. The application of therapy itself results in the encoding of transient gene expression into cellular memory and that this encoding occurs for both transiently induced and probabilistically arising expression. Chromatin accessibility showed concomitant persistence. A two-color AP-1 reporter system showed that these memories are encoded in cis, constituting an example of activating cis epigenetics. Our findings establish the formation and maintenance of cellular memories as a critical aspect of gene regulation during the development of therapy resistance.">

Despite their importance, comprehensive patterns within chromatin state sequences, which could provide insights into key biological functions, remain largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce ChromBERT, a BERT-based model specifically designed to detect distinct patterns of chromatin state annotation data sequences. Notably, ChromBERT was pre-trained on promoter regions across a diverse range of epigenomes and subsequently fine-tuned using a dataset from multiple cell lines where RNA-seq data were available, highlighting the model’s ability to discern conserved chromatin state patterns within these regions. In addition to its predictive powers across tasks, evidenced by high AUC scores, ChromBERT provides further analysis through the incorporation of motif clustering using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). This method enhances the model’s ability to dissect chromatin state sequence motifs, typically involving transcription and enhancer sites. The introduction of motif clustering with DTW into ChromBERT’s workflow is poised to facilitate the discovery of genomic regions linked to novel biological functions, deepening our understanding of chromatin state dynamics.">

        <tr id="Transcription and splicing errors in cancer cells generate erroneous transcripts. Since erroneous transcripts are degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, whether they are junk or could be functional has been overlooked and understudied. We addressed this question by first performing a pan-cancer analysis and identified substantial erroneous noncoding transcripts (ENT) in cancers. Given that RNA/DNA binding domains (DBD) were predicted in ENTs, we deleted predicted DBDs in multiple ENTs in multiple cell lines, with RNA-sequencing and cell experiments before and after DBD deletion. DBD deletion caused significantly changed expression of ENTs’ target genes (whose promoter regions contain ENTs’ DNA binding sites, DBS) and changed cell migration and proliferation ability, indicating that many ENTs can transcriptionally regulate genes. Tightly coupled data analysis and experiments reveal that ENTs’ functions are highly cancer- and cellular-context specific, making ENTs a new class of safe and specific targets for noncoding RNA-based cancer therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is a unique DNA polymerase capable of template-independent extension of DNA with random nucleotides. TdT’s de novo DNA synthesis ability has found utility in DNA recording, DNA data storage, oligonucleotide synthesis, and nucleic acid labeling, but TdT’s intrinsic nucleotide biases limit its versatility in such applications. Here, we describe a multiplexed assay for profiling and engineering the bias and overall activity of TdT variants in high throughput. In our assay, a library of TdTs is encoded next to a CRISPR-Cas9 target site in HEK293T cells. Upon transfection of Cas9 and sgRNA, the target site is cut, allowing TdT to intercept the double strand break and add nucleotides. Each resulting insertion is sequenced alongside the identity of the TdT variant that generated it. Using this assay, 25,623 unique TdT variants, constructed by site-saturation mutagenesis at strategic positions, were profiled. This resulted in the isolation of several altered-bias TdTs that expanded the capabilities of our TdT-based DNA recording system, Cell History Recording by Ordered Insertion (CHYRON), by increasing the information density of recording through an unbiased TdT and achieving dual-channel recording of two distinct inducers (hypoxia and Wnt) through two differently biased TdTs. Select TdT variants were also tested in vitro, revealing concordance between each variant’s in vitro bias and the in vivo bias determined from the multiplexed high throughput assay. Overall, our work, and the multiplex assay it features, should support the continued development of TdT-based DNA recorders, in vitro applications of TdT, and further study of the biology of TdT.">

        <tr id="In recent years, there has been increased focus on exploring the role the non-protein-coding genome plays in Mendelian disorders. One class of particular interest is long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which has recently been implicated in the regulation of diverse molecular processes. However, because lncRNAs do not encode protein, there is uncertainty regarding what constitutes a pathogenic lncRNA variant, and thus annotating such elements is challenging. The Developmental Genome Anatomy Project (DGAP) and similar projects recruit individuals with apparently balanced chromosomal abnormalities (BCAs) that disrupt or dysregulate genes in order to annotate the human genome. We hypothesized that rearrangements disrupting lncRNAs could be the underlying genetic etiology for the phenotypes of a subset of these individuals. Thus, we assessed 279 cases with BCAs and selected 191 cases with simple BCAs (breakpoints at only two genomic locations) for further analysis of lncRNA disruptions. From these, we identified 66 cases in which the chromosomal rearrangements directly disrupt lncRNAs. Strikingly, the lncRNAs MEF2C-AS1 and ENSG00000257522 are each disrupted in two unrelated cases. Furthermore, in 30 cases, no genes of any other class aside from lncRNAs are directly disrupted, consistent with the hypothesis that lncRNA disruptions could underly the phenotypes of these individuals. To showcase the power of this genomic approach for annotating lncRNAs, here we focus on clinical reports and genetic analysis of two individuals with BCAs and additionally highlight six individuals with likely developmental etiologies due to lncRNA disruptions.">

 What’s the pattern of genome-wide chromatin occupancy of SCP3 during meiotic prophase, and how its interaction with chromatin is regulated?



 We document SCP3 enriched at active chromatin regions with largely inherited from leptotene to pachytene stage, which facilitated by transcription and condensate assembly in spermatocytes.



 Meiosis is a critical step during the process of gametogenesis to form haploid cells which finally develop into functional gametes. The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a meiosis-specific protein assembly which bridges homologous chromosomes to establish the architecture of meiotic chromosome. Genetic ablation of genes encoding SC components impedes meiosis and gametogenesis in mice and mutation of these genes is frequently found in infertile patients. SCP3 localization changes with chromosome morphology in autosomes and is involved in maintaining the association of sex chromosomes. Male mice with null mutation of SCP3 failed to form SCs, resulting in developmental arrest during meiotic prophase.



 This study included male mice at post-natal day 10 (P10), 4 weeks or adult (8 weeks or older) were maintained on C57BL/6J background. Spermatocytes were performed modified CUT&Tag using antibodies. ChIP-seq data was analyzed together with WGBS and ATAC-seq data.



 Spermatocytes were obtained by a discontinuous BSA density gradient. Cell pellet was resuspended in culture medium (MEM with 10% FBS) at a concentration of 105 cells/ml and cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Spermatocytes were cultured with or without 1,6-hexanediol or α-amanitin. Spermatocytes with or without drug treatment were collected at indicated time points for further examination and then modified CUT&Tag and co-IP using anti-SCP3 and anti-POL II antibodies.



 Chromatin occupancy of SCP3 in leptotene and pachytene spermatocytes, SCP3-Core sites retained upon treatment of 1,6-hexanediol which dissolves SCP3 condensate, and SCP1 occupancy at meiotic chromatin in pachytene spermatocytes. When we determined inter-peak distances and width of peaks, we observe that: (1) SCP3 occupancy in leptotene stage had greater inter-peak distances and narrower peak width than SCP3 occupancy in pachytene stage, demonstrating gradual accumulated SCP3 at chromatin during meiotic progression; (2) SCP3-Core sites have broader peak width than SCP3-NonCore sites, in agreement with stability of SCP3 occupancy at SCP3-Core sites; (3) SCP1 occupancy had greater inter-peak distances and narrower peak width than SCP3 occupancy in pachytene stage, supporting that SCP1 peaks are a subset of SCP3 peaks and SCP1’s major function in connecting LE and CE respectively. Generally, at pachytene-stage meiosis, SCP3 mainly occupies chromatin regions including transcriptionally active sites, Deu and Alu elements, while SCP1 mainly co-localizes with SCP3 at a subset of regions with open chromatin and high cohesin enrichment to connect meiotic chromosome axes with CE. In this way, a local active chromatin environment is created at meiotic chromosome axes, facilitating homologous chromosome recombination.



 Our test was not successful to examine SCP3 occupancy with as few as less than 1000 spermatocytes using our protocol. It is improvement of efficiency of tagmentation or development of more efficient antibodies against SCP3 will be helpful for clinical sample detection.



 SCP3 occupancy was largely inherited from leptotene to pachytene stage, facilitated by transcription and condensate assembly, and enriched at specific SINE repeats. Further exploration using knockout mouse models of meiotic axial proteins and epigenetic modifiers will provide valuable information on meiotic chromatin architecture and crosstalk among meiotic chromatin events.

        <tr id="The significance of p53’s primary and secondary tumor suppressor programs cannot be overstated. A context- and stress-dependent transcription factor, p53 accumulates to mount its most well-characterized programs in response to a variety of stressors, most notably DNA damage. As cells and tissues never exist in a complete absence of stress, a small amount of p53 exists in cells under physiologic stress, detectable by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing, termed basal p53. Recently, we and others have shown that basal p53 is sufficient to regulate tumor suppressor function. Furthermore, others have suggested the possibility that p53 accumulation in response to experimental stress may be dispensable for its tumor suppression. We previously showed basal p53 occupancy and regulation of known tumor suppressor genes, including PTEN and PHLDA3, in non-transformed breast cells, but this study was limited by experimental stress inherent to cell culture. Given the lack of global characterization of the basal p53 landscape under non-malignant physiologic stress in vivo, we utilized a multi-omics approach to define the murine basal p53 epigenome and its transcriptional program in various normal murine tissues. In this study, we observed basal p53 binding to cis regions of multiple tumor suppressor genes in different tissues, of which some showed p53-dependent regulation of their expression, including Phlda3, Bbc3, Xaf1, and itself. Furthermore, the vast majority of basal p53 target genes were not induced upon irradiation, suggesting basal p53 operates a transcriptional program that is largely distinct from its DNA damage response. Similarly, the basal p53 target gene repertoire is unique to each tissue type.">

        <tr id="Whole-genome (WG) abnormalities, such as uniparental diploidy and triploidy, cause fetal death. Occasionally, they coexist with biparental diploid cells in live births. Understanding the origin and early development of WG abnormal blastomeres is crucial for explaining the formation of androgenotes, gynogenotes, triploidy, chimerism, and mixoploidy. By haplotyping 118 blastomeres from first cleavages, we identified various mechanisms of heterogoneic divisions that lead to WG abnormal blastomeres or their coexistence with normal blastomeres in both multipolar and bipolar cleaving zygotes. After culturing the totipotent blastomeres to three preimplantation stages and performing transcriptome profiling on over 600 cells, we discovered that stress responses contribute to developmental impairment in WG abnormal cells, resulting in either cell arrest or blastocyst formation. However, first-cleavage-derived WG abnormal blastomeres can survive early development and progress to blastocysts. Their potential dominance in preimplantation embryos represents an overlooked cause of abnormal development. Haplotype based screening could further increase pregnancy rates.">

        <tr id="Medulloblastoma (MB) stands as one of the prevalent malignant brain tumors among pediatric patients. Despite its prevalence, the intricate interplay between the regulatory program driving malignancy in MB cells and their interactions with the microenvironment remains insufficiently understood. Leveraging the capabilities of single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq), the chromatin accessibility landscape is unveiled across 59,015 distinct MB cells. This expansive dataset encompasses cells belonging to discrete molecular subgroups, namely SHH, WNT, Group3, and Group4. Within these chromatin accessibility profiles, specific regulatory elements tied to individual subgroups are uncovered, shedding light on the distinct activities of transcription factors (TFs) that likely orchestrate the tumorigenesis process. Moreover, it is found that certain neurotransmitter receptors (NTRs) are subgroup-specific and can predict MB subgroup classification when combined with their associated transcription factors. Notably, targeting essential NTRs within tumors influences both the in vitro sphere-forming capability and the in vivo tumorigenic capacity of MB cells. These findings collectively provide fresh insights into comprehending the regulatory networks and cellular dynamics within MBs. Furthermore, the significance of the TF-NTR regulatory circuits is underscored as prospective biomarkers and viable therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Germline mutations have been identified in a small number of hereditary cancers, but the genetic predisposition for many familial cancers remains to be elucidated. Methods This study identified a Chinese pedigree that presented different cancers (breast cancer, BRCA; adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction, AEG; and B‐cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B‐ALL) in each of the three generations. Whole‐genome sequencing and whole‐exome sequencing were performed on peripheral blood or bone marrow and cancer biopsy samples. Whole‐genome bisulfite sequencing was conducted on the monozygotic twin brothers, one of whom developed B‐ALL. Results According to the ACMG guidelines, bioinformatic analysis of the genome sequencing revealed 20 germline mutations, particularly mutations in the DNAH11 (c.9463G > A) and CFH (c.2314G > A) genes that were documented in the COSMIC database and validated by Sanger sequencing. Forty‐one common somatic mutated genes were identified in the cancer samples, displaying the same type of single nucleotide substitution Signature 5. Meanwhile, hypomethylation of PLEK2, MRAS, and RXRA as well as hypermethylation of CpG island associated with WT1 was shown in the twin with B‐ALL. Conclusions These findings reveal genomic alterations in a pedigree with multiple cancers. Mutations found in the DNAH11, CFH genes, and other genes predispose to malignancies in this family. Dysregulated methylation of WT1, PLEK2, MRAS, and RXRA in the twin with B‐ALL increases cancer susceptibility. The similarity of the somatic genetic changes among the three cancers indicates a hereditary impact on the pedigree. These familial cancers with germline and somatic mutations, as well as epigenomic alterations, represent a common molecular basis for many multiple cancer pedigrees.">

        <tr id="Abstract DNA Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are harmful lesions and major sources of genomic instability. Studies have suggested that DSBs induce local transcriptional silencing that consequently promotes genomic stability. Several factors have been proposed to actively participate in this process, including ATM and Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Here we found that disrupting PRC1 clustering disrupts DSB-induced gene silencing. Interactome analysis of PHC2, a PRC1 subunit that promotes the formation of the Polycomb body, found several nucleoporins that constitute the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC). Similar to PHC2, depleting the nucleoporins also disrupted the DSB-induced gene silencing. We found that some of these nucleoporins, such as NUP107 and NUP43, which are members of the Y-complex of NPC, localize to DSB sites. These nucleoporin-enriched DSBs were distant from the nuclear periphery. The presence of nucleoporins and PHC2 at DSB regions were inter-dependent, suggesting that they act cooperatively in the DSB-induced gene silencing. We further found two structural components within NUP107 to be necessary for the transcriptional repression at DSBs: ATM/ATR-mediated phosphorylation at Serine37 residue within the N-terminal disordered tail, and the NUP133-binding surface at the C-terminus. These results provide a new functional interplay among nucleoporins, ATM and the Polycomb proteins in the DSB metabolism, and underscore their emerging roles in genome stability maintenance. *Hongseon Song, Yubin Bae, Sangin Kim, and Dante Deascanis contributed equally to this work.">

        <tr id="New high-quality human genome assemblies derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) provide reference genomes and pangenomes for genomics studies. However, the characteristics of LCLs pose technical challenges to profiling immunoglobulin (IG) genes. IG loci in LCLs contain a mixture of germline and somatically recombined haplotypes, making them difficult to genotype or assemble accurately. To address these challenges, we introduce IGLoo, a software tool that implements novel methods for analyzing sequence data and genome assemblies derived from LCLs. IGLoo characterizes somatic V(D)J recombination events in the sequence data and identifies the breakpoints and missing IG genes in the LCL-based assemblies. Furthermore, IGLoo implements a novel reassembly framework to improve germline assembly quality by integrating information about somatic events and population structural variantions in the IG loci. We applied IGLoo to study the assemblies from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, providing new insights into the mechanisms, gene usage, and patterns of V(D)J recombination, causes of assembly fragmentation in the IG heavy chain (IGH) locus, and improved representation of the IGH assemblies.">

        <tr id="Epigenetic modifications to DNA and chromatin control oncogenic and tumor suppressive mechanisms in melanoma. EZH2, the catalytic component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which mediates methylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3), can regulate both melanoma initiation and progression. We previously found that mutant Ezh2Y641F interacts with the immune regulator Stat3 and together they affect anti-tumor immunity. However, given the numerous downstream targets and pathways affected by EZH2, many mechanisms that determine its oncogenic activity remain largely unexplored. Using genetically engineered mouse models we further investigated the role of pathways downstream of EZH2 in melanoma carcinogenesis and identified significant enrichment in several autophagy signatures, along with increased expression of autophagy regulators, such as Atg7. In this study, we investigated the effect of Atg7 on melanoma growth and tumor immunity within the context of an Ezh2Y641F epigenetic state. We found that expression of Atg7 is largely dependent on Stat3 expression and that deletion of Atg7 slows down melanoma cell growth in vivo, but not in vitro. Atg7 deletion also results in increased CD8+ T cells and reduced myelosuppressive cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting a strong immune system contribution in the role of Atg7 in melanoma progression. These findings highlight the complex interplay between genetic mutations, epigenetic regulators, and autophagy in shaping tumor immunity in melanoma.">

        <tr id="Whole-genome sequencing efforts has during the past decade unveiled the central role of genomic rearrangements—such as chromosomal inversions—in evolutionary processes, including local adaptation in a wide range of taxa. However, employment of reference genomes from distantly or even closely related species for mapping and the subsequent variant calling, can lead to errors and/or biases in the datasets generated for downstream analyses. Here, we capitalize on the recently generated chromosome-anchored genome assemblies for Arctic cod (Arctogadus glacialis), polar cod (Boreogadus saida), and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) to evaluate the extent and consequences of reference bias on population sequencing datasets (approx. 15-20x coverage) for both Arctic cod and polar cod. Our findings demonstrate that the choice of reference genome impacts population genetic statistics, including individual mapping depth, heterozygosity levels, and cross-species comparisons of nucleotide diversity (π) and genetic divergence (DXY). Further, it became evident that using a more distantly related reference genome can lead to inaccurate detection and characterization of chromosomal inversions, i.e., in terms of size (length) and location (position), due to inter-chromosomal reorganizations between species. Additionally, we observe that several of the detected species-specific inversions were split into multiple genomic regions when mapped towards a heterospecific reference. Inaccurate identification of chromosomal rearrangements as well as biased population genetic measures could potentially lead to erroneous interpretation of species-specific genomic diversity, impede the resolution of local adaptation, and thus, impact predictions of their genomic potential to respond to climatic and other environmental perturbations.">

        <tr id="The holoparasitic plant Lophophytum mirabile exhibits remarkable levels of mitochondrial horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Gathering comparative data from other individuals and host plants can provide insights into the HGT process. We sequenced the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) from individuals of two species of Lophophytum and from mimosoid hosts. We applied a stringent phylogenomic approach to elucidate the origin of the whole mtDNAs, estimate the timing of the transfers, and understand the molecular mechanisms involved. Ancestral and recent HGT events replaced and enlarged the multichromosomal mtDNA of Lophophytum spp., with the foreign DNA ascending to 74%. A total of 14 foreign mitochondrial chromosomes originated from continuous regions in the host mtDNA flanked by short direct repeats. These foreign tracts are circularized by microhomology-mediated repair pathways and replicate independently until they are lost or they eventually recombine with other chromosomes. The foreign noncoding chromosomes are variably present in the population and likely evolve by genetic drift. We present the 'circle-mediated HGT' model in which foreign mitochondrial DNA tracts become circular and are maintained as plasmid-like molecules. This model challenges the conventional belief that foreign DNA must be integrated into the recipient genome for successful HGT.">

        <tr id="During the metagenomics era, high-throughput sequencing efforts both in mice and humans indicate that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute a significant fraction of the transcribed genome. During the past decades, the regulatory role of these non-coding transcripts along with their interactions with other molecules have been extensively characterized. However, the study of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), an ncRNA regulatory class with transcript lengths that exceed 200 nucleotides, revealed that certain non-coding transcripts are transcriptional “by-products”, while their loci exert their downstream regulatory functions through RNA-independent mechanisms. Such mechanisms include, but are not limited to, chromatin interactions and complex promoter-enhancer competition schemes that involve the underlying ncRNA locus with or without its nascent transcription, mediating significant or even exclusive roles in the regulation of downstream target genes in mammals. Interestingly, such RNA-independent mechanisms often drive pathological manifestations, including oncogenesis. In this review, we summarize selective examples of lncRNAs that regulate target genes independently of their produced transcripts.">

        <tr id="TBC1D3 is a primate-specific gene family that has expanded in the human lineage and has been implicated in neuronal progenitor proliferation and expansion of the frontal cortex. The gene family and its expression have been challenging to investigate because it is embedded in high-identity and highly variable segmental duplications. We sequenced and assembled the gene family using long-read sequencing data from 34 humans and 11 non-human primate species. Our analysis shows that this particular gene family has independently duplicated in at least five primate lineages, and the duplicated loci are enriched at sites of large-scale chromosomal rearrangements on Chromosome 17. We find that all human copy number variation maps to two distinct clusters located at Chromosome 17q12 and that humans are highly structurally variable at this locus, differing by as many as 20 copies and ~1 Mbp in length depending on haplotypes. We also show evidence of positive selection, as well as a significant change in the predicted human TBC1D3 protein sequence. Lastly, we find that, despite multiple duplications, human TBC1D3 expression is limited to a subset of copies and, most notably, from a single paralog group: TBC1D3-CDKL These observations may help explain why a gene potentially important in cortical development can be so variable in the human population.">

        <tr id="Tumors often show an initial response to chemotherapy, but then develop resistance, leading to relapse and poor prognosis. We hypothesized that a genomic comparison of mutations in pre-treated versus treatment-naive tumors would serve to identify genes that confer resistance. A challenge in such an analysis is that therapy alters mutation burdens and signatures, confounding association studies and complicating identifying causal, selected mutations. We developed DiffInvex, a framework for identifying changes in selection acting on individual genes in somatic genomes. Crucially, DiffInvex draws on a mutation rate baseline that accounts for these shifts in neutral mutagenesis during cancer evolution. We applied DiffInvex to 9,953 cancer whole-genomes from 29 cancer types from 8 studies, containing both WGS of treatment-naive tumors and tumors pre-treated by various drugs, identifying genes where point mutations are under conditional positive or negative selection for a certain chemotherapeutic, suggesting resistance mechanisms occurring via point mutation. DiffInvex confirmed well-known chemoresistance-driver mutations in EGFR, ESR1, KIT and AR genes as being under conditional positive selection, with additional cancer types identified for EGFR and KIT. Additionally, DiffInvex identified 11 genes with treatment-associated selection for different classes of therapeutics. In most cases, these genes were common cancer genes including PIK3CA, APC, MAP2K4 and MAP3K1. This suggests that tumor resistance to therapy via mutation often occurs via selective advantages conferred by known driver genes, rather than via mutations in specialized resistance genes. Various gene-chemotherapy associations were further supported in tests for functional impact of mutations, again implemented in a conditional selection setting, as well as replicating in independent panel or exome sequencing data. In addition to nominating drug resistance genes that could be targeted by future therapeutics, DiffInvex can also be applied to diverse analysis in cancer evolution, such as comparing normal and tumoral tissues, or analyzing subclonal evolution, identifying changes in selection over time.">

        <tr id="Replication stress (RS) is a key trait of cancer cells, and a potential actionable target in cancer treatment. Accurate methods to measure RS in tumour samples are currently lacking. DNA fibre analysis has been used as a common technique to measure RS in cell lines. Here, we investigated DNA fibre analysis on fresh breast cancer specimens and correlated DNA replication kinetics to known RS markers and genomic alterations. Fresh, treatment-naïve primary breast cancer samples (n = 74) were subjected to ex vivo DNA fibre analysis to measure DNA replication kinetics. Tumour cell proliferation was confirmed by EdU incorporation and cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (CK) staining. The RS markers phospho-S33-RPA and γH2AX and the RS-inducing proto-oncogenes Cyclin E1 and c-Myc were analysed by immunohistochemistry. Copy number variations (CNVs) were assessed from genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. We found that the majority of proliferating (EdU-positive) cells in each sample were CK-positive and therefore considered to be tumour cells. DNA fibre lengths varied largely in most tumour samples. The median DNA fibre length showed a significant inverse correlation with pRPA expression (r = -0.29, p = 0.033) but was not correlated with Cyclin E1 or c-Myc expression and global CNVs in this study. Nuclear Cyclin E1 expression showed a positive correlation with pRPA levels (r = 0.481, p < 0.0001), while cytoplasmic Cyclin E1 expression exhibited an inverse association with pRPA expression (r = -0.353, p = 0.002) and a positive association with global CNVs (r = 0.318, p = 0.016). In conclusion, DNA fibre analysis performed with fresh primary breast cancer samples is feasible. Fibre lengths were associated with pRPA expression. Cyclin E1 expression was associated with pRPA and the percentage of CNVs. © 2024 The Author(s).

        <tr id="Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is essential for various DNA-templated processes in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. However, comprehensive characterizations of ssDNA still lag in plants compared to non-plant systems. Here, we conducted in situ S1-seq (ISS1-seq), with starting gDNA ranging from 5 µg to 250 ng, followed by comprehensive characterizations of ssDNA in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We found that ssDNA loci were substantially associated with a subset of non-B DNA structures and functional genomic loci. Subtypes of ssDNA loci had distinct epigenetic features. Importantly, ssDNA may act alone or partly coordinate with non-B DNA structures, functional genomic loci, or epigenetic marks to actively or repressively modulate gene transcription, which is genomic-region-dependent and associated with the distinct accumulation of RNA Pol II. Moreover, distinct types of ssDNA had differential impacts on the activities and evolution of TEs (especially common or conserved TEs) in the rice genome. Our study showcases an antibody-independent technique for characterizing non-B DNA structures or functional genomic loci in plants. It lays the groundwork and fills a crucial gap for further exploration of ssDNA, non-B DNA structures, or functional genomic loci, thereby advancing our understanding of their biology in plants.">

        <tr id="The genetic integrity of pluripotent stem cells (PSC) is integral to their applications in research and therapy, but it is compromised by frequent development of copy number variations. Little is known about the basis of the variable genomic integrity among different PSC lines. Here we identify aneuploidies using RNA-seq and proteomics data from a panel of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines derived from 170 Diversity Outbred mice. We identified 62 lines with detectable aneuploid subpopulations and a subset of originally XX lines that lost one Chromosome X (XO). Strikingly, a much lower proportion of XX lines were aneuploid, compared to XY or XO lines. Two single-cell RNA-seq data sets demonstrated that aneuploid XY DO mESC also show lower Chromosome X gene expression and that XY mESC accumulate higher aneuploid proportions in culture than isogenic XX lines. Possible mechanisms for this protective effect of X chromosome dosage include our discovery that the lines with two active X Chromosomes have a higher expression of 2-cell-like state genes, and differential expression of X-linked tumor suppressor genes associated with DNA damage response.

        <tr id="A recent publication describing the assembly of the Y chromosomes of 43 males was remarkable not only for its ambitious technical scope, but also for the startling suggestion that the boundary of the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1), where the human X and Y chromosomes engage in crossing-over during male meiosis, lies 500 kb distal to its previously reported location1. Where is the boundary of the human PAR1? We first review the evidence that mapped the PAR boundary, or PAB, before the human genome draft sequence was produced, then examine post-genomic datasets for evidence of crossing-over between the X and Y, and lastly re-examine the sequence assemblies presented by Hallast and colleagues to see whether they support a more distal PAB. We find ample evidence of X-Y crossovers throughout the 500 kb in question, some as close as 246 bp to the previously reported PAB. Our new analyses, combined with previous studies over the past 40 years, provide overwhelming evidence to support the original position, and narrow the probable location of the PAB to a 201-bp window.">

        <tr id="Telomeric DNA, composed of short, direct repeats, is of crucial importance for chromosome stability. Due to intrinsic problems with replicating this DNA, the repeat tracts shorten at each cell division. Once repeat tracts become critically short, a telomeric stress signal induces cellular senescence and division arrest, which eventually may lead to devastating age-related degenerative diseases associated with dysfunctional telomers. Conversely, maintenance of telomere length by telomerase upregulation is a hallmark of cancer. Therefore, telomere length is a critical determinant of telomere function. How telomere length is established and molecular mechanisms for telomere-specific length regulation remained unknown. Here we show that subtelomeric chromatin is a determinant for how telomere equilibrium set-length is established in cis. The results demonstrate that telomerase recruitment mediated by the telomere-associated Sir4 protein is modulated on chromosome 3L in a telomere-specific way. Increased Sir4 abundance on subtelomeric heterochromatin of this specific telomere leads to telomere lengthening of only that telomere in cis, but not at other telomeres. Therefore, this work describes a mechanism for a how telomere-specific repeat tract length can be established. Further, our results will force the evaluation of telomere length away from a generalized view to a more telomere-specific consideration.">

This study builds on our previous work demonstrating that the RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) transcription inhibitor CX-5461 elicits a non-canonical DNA damage response and our discovery of a critical role for Topoisomerase 2α (Top2α) in the initiation of Pol I-dependent transcription. Here, we identify Top2α as a mediator of CX-5461 response in the murine Eµ-Myc B lymphoma model whereby sensitivity to CX-5461 is dependent on cellular Top2α expression/activity. Most strikingly, and in contrast to canonical Top2α poisons, we found that the Top2α-dependent DNA damage induced by CX-5461 is preferentially localized at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) promoter region, thereby highlighting CX-5461 as a loci-specific DNA damaging agent. This mechanism underpins the efficacy of CX-5461 against certain types of cancer and can be used to develop effective non-genotoxic anticancer drugs.">

We found no clear genetic or epigenetic differences between essential and nonessential hubs, but we observed that some neighboring hubs in the linear genome have distinct spatial contacts and opposite effects on cell growth. One such pair in an epigenetically quiescent region showed different impacts on gene expression, chromatin accessibility and chromatin organization. We also found that deleting the essential hub altered the genetic network activity and increased the entropy of chromatin accessibility, more severe than that caused by deletion of the nonessential hub, suggesting that they are critical for maintaining an ordered chromatin structure.

        <tr id="The centromeric protein-A (CENP-A) is an evolutionary conserved histone H3 variant that marks the identity of the centromeres. Several mechanisms regulate the centromeric deposition of CENP-A as its mislocalization causes erroneous chromosome segregation, leading to aneuploidy-based diseases, including cancers. The most crucial deposition factor is a CENP-A specific chaperone, HJURP (Scm3 in budding yeast), which specifically binds to CENP-A. However, the discovery of HJURP as a DDR (DNA damage repair) protein and evidence of its binding to Holliday junctions in vitro indicate a CENP-A-deposition-independent role of these chaperones. In this study, using budding yeast, we demonstrate that Scm3 is crucial for the DDR pathway as scm3 cells are sensitive to DNA damage. We further observe that the scm3 mutant interacts with the rad52 DDR mutant and is compromised in activating DDR-mediated arrest. We demonstrate that Scm3 associates with the DNA damage sites and undergoes posttranslational modifications upon DNA damage. Overall, from this report and earlier studies on HJURP, we conclude that DDR functions of CENP-A chaperones are conserved across eukaryotes. Thus, the revelation that these chaperones confer genome stability in more than one pathway has clinical significance.">

In this study, we identified 967 MB survival-related genes (SRGs) using a gene expression dataset and the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Notably, the SRGs were over-represented on chromosomes 6 and 17, known for the abnormalities monosomy 6 and isochromosome 17 in MB. The most significant SRG was HMGA1 (high mobility group AT-hook 1) on chromosome 6, which is a known oncogene and a histone H1 competitor. High expression of HMGA1 was associated with worse survival, primarily in the Group 3γ subtype. The high expression of HMGA1 was unrelated to any known somatic copy number alteration. Most SRGs on chromosome 17p were associated with low expression in Group 4β, the MB subtype, with 93% deletion of 17p and 98% copy gain of 17q. GO enrichment analysis showed that both chromosomes 6 and 17 included SRGs related to telomere maintenance and provided a rationale for testing telomerase inhibitors in Group 3 MBs. We conclude that HMGA1, along with other SRGs on chromosomes 6 and 17, warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic targets in selected subgroups or subtypes of MB.">

Previous studies identified candidate CREs (cCREs) using epigenetic features in one species, making comparisons difficult between species. In contrast, we conducted an interspecies study defining epigenetic states and identifying cCREs in blood cell types to generate regulatory maps that are comparable between species, using integrative modeling of eight epigenetic features jointly in human and mouse in our Validated Systematic Integration (VISION) Project. The resulting catalogs of cCREs are useful resources for further studies of gene regulation in blood cells, indicated by high overlap with known functional elements and strong enrichment for human genetic variants associated with blood cell phenotypes. The contribution of each epigenetic state in cCREs to gene regulation, inferred from a multivariate regression, was used to estimate epigenetic state Regulatory Potential (esRP) scores for each cCRE in each cell type, which were used to categorize dynamic changes in cCREs. Groups of cCREs displaying similar patterns of regulatory activity in human and mouse cell types, obtained by joint clustering on esRP scores, harbored distinctive transcription factor binding motifs that were similar between species. An interspecies comparison of cCREs revealed both conserved and species-specific patterns of epigenetic evolution. Finally, we showed that comparisons of the epigenetic landscape between species can reveal elements with similar roles in regulation, even in the absence of genomic sequence alignment.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
Ionizing radiation generates genomic instability by promoting the accumulation of chromosomal rearrangements. The oncogenic translocation RET/PTC1 is present in more than 70% of radiation-induced thyroid cancers. Both RET and CCDC6, the genes implicated in RET/PTC1, are found within common fragile sites - chromosomal regions prone to DNA breakage during slight replication stress. Given that irradiated cells become more susceptible to genomic destabilization due to the accumulation of replication-stress-related double-strand breaks (DSBs), we explored whether RET and CCDC6 exhibit DNA breakage under replicative stress several days post-irradiation of thyroid cells.


METHODS
We analyzed the dynamic of DNA replication in human thyroid epithelial cells (HThy-ori-3.1) 4 days post a 5-Gy exposure using molecular DNA combing. The DNA replication schedule was evaluated through replication-timing experiments. We implemented a ChIP-qPCR assay to determine whether the RET and CCDC6 genes break following irradiation.


RESULTS
Our study indicates that replicative stress, occurring several days post-irradiation in thyroid cells, primarily causes DSBs in the RET gene. We discovered that both the RET and CCDC6 genes undergo late replication in thyroid cells. However, only RET's replication rate is notably delayed after irradiation.


CONCLUSION
The findings suggest that post-irradiation in the RET gene causes a breakage in the replication fork, which could potentially invade another genomic area, including CCDC6. As a result, this could greatly contribute to the high prevalence of chromosomal RET/PTC rearrangements seen in patients exposed to external radiation.">

        <tr id="Maintenance of genome stability is of paramount importance for the survival of an organism. However, genomic integrity is constantly being challenged by various endogenous and exogenous processes that damage DNA. Therefore, cells are heavily reliant on DNA repair pathways that have evolved to deal with every type of genotoxic insult that threatens to compromise genome stability. Notably, inherited mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in these protective pathways trigger the onset of disease that is driven by chromosome instability e.g. neurodevelopmental abnormalities, neurodegeneration, premature ageing, immunodeficiency and cancer development. The ability of cells to regulate the recruitment of specific DNA repair proteins to sites of DNA damage is extremely complex but is primarily mediated by protein post-translational modifications (PTMs). Ubiquitylation is one such PTM, which controls genome stability by regulating protein localisation, protein turnover, protein-protein interactions and intra-cellular signalling. Over the past two decades, numerous ubiquitin (Ub) E3 ligases have been identified to play a crucial role not only in the initiation of DNA replication and DNA damage repair but also in the efficient termination of these processes. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of how different Ub E3 ligases (RNF168, TRAIP, HUWE1, TRIP12, FANCL, BRCA1, RFWD3) function to regulate DNA repair and replication and the pathological consequences arising from inheriting deleterious mutations that compromise the Ub-dependent DNA damage response.">

Single-molecule microscopy uncovered the localization dynamics of crRNP complexes. The tracks of fluorescently labeled crRNPs co-localized with regions of increased plasmid replication, supporting efficient plasmid targeting.

Here we review the latest findings using Hi-C and discuss the main features of bacterial genome folding.">

        <tr id="Motivation Techniques such as high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) have provided a wealth of information on the organization of the nucleus and the genome important for understanding gene expression regulation. Additionally, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWASs) have uncovered thousands of loci related to complex traits. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies have further linked the genetic variants to alteration in expression levels of associated target genes across individuals. However, the functional roles of many eQTLs located in non-coding regions are unclear. Current joint analyses of Hi-C and eQTLs data lack advanced computational tools, limiting what can be learned from these data. Result In this work, we developed a computational method for simultaneous analysis of Hi-C and eQTL data. Our method can identify a small set of non-random interactions from all Hi-C interactions. Using these non-random interactions, we reconstruct large ensemble (×105) of high-resolution single-cell 3D chromatin conformations with thorough sampling, which accurately replicate Hi-C measurements. Our results revealed the presence of many-body interactions in chromatin conformation at single-cell level in eQTL locus, offering detailed view into how three-dimensional structures of chromatin form the physical foundation for gene regulation, including how genetic variants of eQTLs affect the expression level of their associated eGenes. Furthermore, our method can deconvolve chromatin heterogeneity and investigate the spatial associations of eQTLs and eGenes at subpopulation level to reveal their regulatory impacts on gene expression. Together, ensemble modeling of thoroughly sampled single cell chromatin conformations from Hi-C, along with eQTL data, helps to decipher how chromatin 3D structures provide the physical basis for gene regulation, expression control, and aid in understanding of the overall structure-function relationships of genome organization.

In the last 10–15 years, thanks to this systematic implementation of large-scale sequencing, the identification of hotspot somatic mutations in histone genes came into the limelight, underscoring the concept of oncohistones. As drivers in pediatric brain tumors, and in several other types of cancers, oncohistones brought a “new dimension of Strange” into the cancer multiverse, to paraphrase Marvel. An integrative approach to cancer complexity as a multidimensional projection is urgently needed to consider all relevant etiological, developmental, and evolutionary components. Here, we discuss recent progress on histone variants and chaperones, their regulation and alterations in cancers, the available in vivo models, and current treatment strategies. More specifically, we adopt a view through the lens of tissue-specific differences and means for genome expression and integrity maintenance.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) stands as one of the most prevalent and aggressive forms of renal malignancies, accounting for a substantial portion of kidney cancer-related mortality worldwide. The heterogeneity within ccRCC poses a significant challenge to understanding its molecular mechanisms and devising effective therapeutic strategies. [1] Previous studies utilizing single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) have revealed transcriptional contributions to cell-type specificity in both mature human and mouse kidneys. Moreover, recent advancements have expanded this approach to single-cell profiling of chromatin accessibility. Single-nuclei assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq) has enabled the measurement of chromatin accessibility in thousands of individual cells, providing insights into the dynamic process that drives nephron development and differentiation. Integration and analysis of multimodal single-cell datasets, such as snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq, allows for the prediction of cell-type-specific cis-regulatory DNA interactions and transcription factor activity, complementing the transcriptional information obtained by snRNA-seq.[2] [3] [1] Yang, Wang, and Yang, “Treatment Strategies for Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.” [2] Muto et al., “Single Cell Transcriptional and Chromatin Accessibility Profiling Redefine Cellular Heterogeneity in the Adult Human Kidney.” [3] Monteagudo-Sánchez, Noordermeer, and Greenberg, “The Impact of DNA Methylation on CTCF-Mediated 3D Genome Organization.” Methods This study leveraged paired snRNA/ATAC-seq in tumor and normal-adjacent samples from the Renal Tumor Biobank at Dartmouth (n= 63) to explore the ccRCC landscape at single-cell resolution using 10x multiome technology. The snRNA-seq dataset was processed with Seurat v5.0 to remove low-quality nuclei. Doublets were removed with DoubletFinder v2.02, and ambient DNA was removed using decontX from celda. Normalization was conducted via SCTransform, and missing data was imputed with ALRA. Clustering was performed by constructing a KNN graph and running the Louvain algorithm. Cell type assignments were predicted using Azimuth with the human kidney reference dataset. The snATAC-seq data was processed with ArchR v1.0.1, which performed dimensionality reduction and clustering. Cluster identities defined in the Seurat workflow were cross-annotated to the ATAT-seq data, and open peaks were identified within these cell-type clusters using MACS3 v3.0.1. Identification of marker peaks, motif enrichment, and motif enrichment deviations were inferred utilizing ArchR’s getmarkerFeatures, peakAnnoEnrichment, and addMotifAnnotations functions, respectively. Results Motif enrichment analysis revealed canonical cancer-associated transcription factor (TF) dysregulation in tumor cells (nephron loop-like), including enrichment of HNF1B, SMARCC1, FOSL1, and JUND. Interestingly, HNF and SMARCC were also enriched in the lymphoid compartment, indicating possible crosstalk between these two cell types. Previous work has investigated the involvement of the HNF1 in ccRCC and in chromophobe RCC for prognosis,and we plan on investigating the relationship of these enrichments to tumor grade, stage and outcome.[1] Additional TF enrichments included BCL families and ELF within the myeloid compartment, and vascularization related TF families in endothelial cell types including enrichment of various ETS TFs. Investigation of cell-cell interactions between immune and endothelial cell populations as well as between tumor and normal adjacent tissues will be performed to further disentangle the role differentially accessable chromatin plays in ccRCC. [1] Buchner et al., “Downregulation of HNF-1B in Renal Cell Carcinoma Is Associated With Tumor Progression and Poor Prognosis.” Conclusions Our multi-omic approach has several advantages. First, it enables the characterization of cellular heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment, identifying cell populations and their contributions to disease progression. Secondly, by integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic data, we gain insights into the dynamic interplay between gene expression and chromatin accessibility, uncovering potential therapeutic vulnerabilities and biomarkers for personalized treatment strategies.

        <tr id="DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism orchestrating gene expression networks in many biological processes. Nonetheless, studying the role of specific gene methylation events in fish faces challenges. In this study, we validate the regulation of DNA methylation on empty spiracles homeobox 2 (emx2) expression with decitabine treatment in Chinese tongue sole testis cells. We used the emx2 gene as the target gene and developed a new DNA methylation editing system by fusing dnmt3a with catalytic dead Cas9 (dCas9) and demonstrated its ability for sequence-specific DNA methylation editing. Results revealed that utilizing dCas9-dnmt3a to target emx2 promoter region led to increased DNA methylation levels and decreased emx2 expression in Chinese tongue sole testis cells. More importantly, the DNA methylation editing significantly suppressed the expression of MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor (myc), one target gene of emx2. Furthermore, we assessed the off-target effects of dCas9-dnmt3a and confirmed no significant impact on the predicted off-target gene expression. Taken together, we developed the first DNA methylation editing system in marine species and demonstrated its effective editing ability in Chinese tongue sole cells. This provides a new strategy for both epigenetic research and molecular breeding of marine species.">

The mechanisms of intra-tumor heterogeneity in ccRCC have yet to be fully established. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) data from a single-cell multi-omics perspective. Based on consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) algorithm, functionally heterogeneous cancer cells were classified into metabolism, inflammatory, and EMT meta programs, with spatial transcriptomics sequencing (stRNA-seq) providing spatial information of such disparate meta programs of cancer cells. The bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed high clinical prognostic values of functionally heterogeneous cancer cells of three meta programs, with transcription factor regulatory network and motif activities revealing the key transcription factors that regulate functionally heterogeneous ccRCC cells. The interactions between varying meta programs and other cell subpopulations in the microenvironment were investigated. Finally, we assessed the sensitivity of cancer cells of disparate meta programs to different anti-cancer agents. Our findings inform on the intra-tumor heterogeneity of ccRCC and its regulatory networks and offers new perspectives to facilitate the designs of rational therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="MYC has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide range of human tumors and has been described for many years as a transcription factor that regulates genes with pleiotropic functions to promote tumorigenic growth. However, despite extensive efforts to identify specific target genes of MYC that alone could be responsible for promoting tumorigenesis, the field is yet to reach a consensus whether this is the crucial function of MYC. Recent work shifts the view on MYC's function from being a gene-specific transcription factor to an essential stress resilience factor. In highly proliferating cells, MYC preserves cell integrity by promoting DNA repair at core promoters, protecting stalled replication forks, and/or preventing transcription-replication conflicts. Furthermore, an increasing body of evidence demonstrates that MYC not only promotes tumorigenesis by driving cell-autonomous growth, but also enables tumors to evade the host's immune system. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of how MYC impairs antitumor immunity and why this function is evolutionarily hard-wired to the biology of the MYC protein family. We show why the cell-autonomous and immune evasive functions of MYC are mutually dependent and discuss ways to target MYC proteins in cancer therapy.">

In screening experiments, we found that circPCMTD1 depletion strongly inhibited the proliferative capacity of leukemic cells with BCR-ABL translocations. Mass cytometry experiments identified the aberrant activation of the DNA damage response as an early downstream event of circPCMTD1 depletion. In in vivo experiments, circPCMTD1 targeting prolonged the survival of mice engrafted with leukemic blasts harboring the Philadelphia chromosome. Mechanistically, we found that circPCMTD1 was enriched in the cytoplasm and associated with the ribosomes of the leukemic cells. We detected a cryptic open reading frame within the circPCMTD1 sequence and found that circPCMTD1 could generate a peptide product. The circPCMTD1-derived peptide interacted with proteins of the BTR complex and enhanced BTR complex formation, thereby increasing tolerance to genotoxic stress.">

        <tr id="Premature aging is a hallmark of Down syndrome, caused by trisomy of human chromosome 21, but the reason is unclear and difficult to study in humans. We used an aneuploid model in wild yeast to show that chromosome amplification disrupts nutrient-induced cell-cycle arrest, quiescence entry, and healthy aging, across genetic backgrounds and amplified chromosomes. We discovered that these defects are due in part to aneuploidy-induced dysfunction in Ribosome Quality Control (RQC). Compared to euploids, aneuploids entering quiescence display aberrant ribosome profiles, accumulate RQC intermediates, and harbor an increased load of protein aggregates. Although they have normal proteasome capacity, aneuploids show signs of ubiquitin dysregulation, which impacts cyclin abundance to disrupt arrest. Remarkably, inducing ribosome stalling in euploids produces similar aberrations, while up-regulating limiting RQC subunits or proteins in ubiquitin metabolism alleviates many of the aneuploid defects. Our results provide implications for other aneuploidy disorders including Down syndrome.">

        <tr id="Each piece of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has a length determined by the exact metabolic conditions in the cell it belonged to at the time of cell death. The changes in cellular regulation leading to a variety of patterns, which are based on the different number of fragments with lengths up to several hundred base pairs at each of the almost three billion genomic positions, allow for the detection of disease and also the precise identification of the tissue of their origin. A Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence computation identifies different fragment lengths and areas of the human genome, depending on the stage, for which disease samples, starting from pre-clinical disease stages, diverge from healthy donor samples. We provide examples of genes related to colorectal cancer (CRC), which our algorithm detected to belong to divergent genomic bins. The staging of CRC can be viewed as a Markov Chain and that provides a framework for studying disease progression and the types of epigenetic changes occurring longitudinally at each stage, which might aid the correct classification of a new hospital sample. In a new look to treat such data as grayscale value images, pattern recognition using artificial intelligence (AI) could be one approach to classification. In CRC, Stage I disease does not, for the most part, shed any tumor circulation, making detection difficult for established machine learning (ML) methods. This leads to the deduction that early detection, where we can only rely on changes in the metabolic patterns, can be accomplished when the information is considered in its entirety, for example by applying computer vision methods.">

The Telomere Repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) is synthesized in T. brucei by Pol I readthrough transcription of a telomeric PTU. While little is understood regarding TERRA synthesis and function, the hyper-modified DNA base J is highly enriched at telomeres in L. major promastigotes. We now show that TERRA is synthesized by Pol II in L. major and loss of base J leads to increased TERRA. For at least one site, the increased TERRA is by Pol II readthrough transcription from an adjacent PTU. Furthermore, Pol II readthrough defects and increased TERRA correlate with increased differentiation of promastigotes to the infectious metacyclic life stage and decreased cell viability. These results help explain the essential nature of base J in Leishmania and provide insight regarding epigenetic control of coding and non-coding RNA expression and parasite development during the life cycle of L. major.">

        <tr id="The endonuclease activity of Pms1 directs mismatch repair by generating a nick in the newly replicated DNA strand. Inactivating Pms2, the human homologue of yeast Pms1, increases the chances of colorectal and uterine cancers. Here we use whole genome sequencing to show that loss of this endonuclease activity, via the pms1-DE variant, results in strong mutator effects throughout the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Mutation rates are strongly increased for mutations resulting from all types of single-base substitutions and for a wide variety of single- and multi-base indel mutations. Rates for these events are further increased in strains combining pms1-DE with mutator variants of each of the three major leading and lagging strand replicases. In all cases, mutation rates, spectra, biases, and context preferences are statistically indistinguishable from strains with equivalent polymerases but lacking initial mismatch recognition due to deletion of MSH2. This implies that, across the nuclear genome, strand discrimination via the Pms1 endonuclease is as important for MMR as is initial mismatch recognition by Msh2 heterodimers.">

        <tr id="Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease, in which a number of genetic and epigenetic changes occur in tumor onset and progression. Recent studies indicate that changes at the RNA level are also involved in tumorigenesis, such as adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing. Here, we systematically investigate transcriptome-wide A-to-I editing events in a large number of samples from Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). Using a computational pipeline that determines significant differences in editing level between NHL and normal samples at known A-to-I editing sites, we identify a number of differentially edited editing sites between NHL subtypes and normal samples. Most of the differentially edited sites are located in non-coding regions, and many such sites show a strong correlation between gene expression level and editing efficiency, indicating that RNA editing might have direct consequences for the cancer cell’s aberrant gene regulation status in these cases. Moreover, we establish a strong link between RNA editing and NHL by demonstrating that NHL and normal samples and even NHL subtypes can be distinguished based on genome-wide RNA editing profiles alone. Our study establishes a strong link between RNA editing, cancer and aberrant gene regulation in NHL.">

        <tr id="Precise DNA replication is fundamental for genetic inheritance. In eukaryotes, replication initiates at multiple origins that are first "licensed" and subsequently "fired" to activate DNA synthesis. Despite the success in identifying origins with specific DNA motifs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, no consensus sequence or sequences with a predictive value of replication origins have been recognized in metazoan genomes. Rather, epigenetic rules and chromatin structures are believed to play important roles in governing the selection and activation of replication origins. We propose that replication initiation is facilitated by a group of sequence-specific "replication pioneer factors," which function to increase chromatin accessibility and foster a chromatin environment that is conducive to the loading of the prereplication complex. Dysregulation of the function of these factors may lead to gene duplication, genomic instability, and ultimately the occurrence of pathological conditions such as cancer.">

        <tr id="Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic condition characterized by features of accelerated aging, and individuals with HGPS seldom live beyond their mid-teens. The syndrome is commonly caused by a point mutation in the LMNA gene which codes for lamin A and its splice variant lamin C, components of the nuclear lamina. The mutation causing HGPS leads to production of a truncated, farnesylated form of lamin A referred to as “progerin.” Progerin is also expressed at low levels in healthy individuals and appears to play a role in normal aging. HGPS is associated with an accumulation of genomic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and alterations in the nature of DSB repair. The source of DSBs in HGPS is often attributed to stalling and subsequent collapse of replication forks in conjunction with faulty recruitment of repair factors to damage sites. In this work, we used a model system involving immortalized human cell lines to investigate progerin-induced genomic damage. Using an immunofluorescence approach to visualize phosphorylated histone H2AX foci which mark sites of genomic damage, we report that cells engineered to express progerin displayed a significant elevation of endogenous damage in the absence of any change in the cell cycle profile or doubling time of cells. Genomic damage was enhanced and persistent in progerin-expressing cells treated with hydroxyurea. Overexpression of wild-type lamin A did not elicit the outcomes associated with progerin expression. Our results show that DNA damage caused by progerin can occur independently from global changes in replication or cell proliferation.">

        <tr id="Human APOBEC single-strand (ss) specific DNA and RNA cytidine deaminases change cytosines to uracils and function in antiviral innate immunity, RNA editing, and can cause hypermutation in chromosomes. The resulting uracils can be directly replicated, resulting in C to T mutations, or uracil-DNA glycosylase can convert the uracils to abasic (AP) sites which are then fixed as C to T or C to G mutations by translesion DNA polymerases. We noticed that in yeast and in human cancers, contributions of C to T and C to G mutations depends on the origin of ssDNA mutagenized by APOBECs. Since ssDNA in eukaryotic genomes readily binds to replication protein A (RPA) we asked if RPA could affect APOBEC-induced mutation spectrum in yeast. For that purpose, we expressed human APOBECs in the wild-type yeast and in strains carrying a hypomorph mutation rfa1-t33 in the large RPA subunit. We confirmed that the rfa1-t33 allele can facilitate mutagenesis by APOBECs. We also found that the rfa1-t33 mutation changed the ratio of APOBEC3A-induced T to C and T to G mutations in replicating yeast to resemble a ratio observed in long-persistent ssDNA in yeast and in cancers. We present the data suggesting that RPA may shield APOBEC formed uracils in ssDNA from Ung1, thereby facilitating C to T mutagenesis through the accurate copying of uracils by replicative DNA polymerases. Unexpectedly, we also found that for uracils shielded from Ung1 by wild-type RPA the mutagenic outcome is reduced in the presence of translesion DNA polymerase zeta.">

Non-mutational epigenetic changes alter cells’ transcriptional profile and are a key feature found in many tumors. In contrast to genetic mutations, epigenetic changes are reversable, and restoring a normal epigenetic profile can inhibit tumor growth and progression. Lysine acetyltransferases (KATs or HATs) protect genome stability and integrity, and Tip60 is an essential acetyltransferase due to its roles as an epigenetic and transcriptional regulator, and as master regulator of the DNA double-strand break response. Tip60 is commonly downregulated and mislocalized in many cancers, and the roles that mislocalized Tip60 plays in cancer are not well understood. Here we categorize and discuss Tip60-regulated genes, evaluate Tip60-interacting proteins based on cellular localization, and explore the therapeutic potential of Tip60-targeting compounds as epigenetic inhibitors. Understanding the multiple roles Tip60 plays in tumorigenesis will improve our understanding of tumor progression and will inform therapeutic options, including informing potential combinatorial regimes with current chemotherapeutics, leading to improvements in patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT This research investigates the intricate dynamics of DNA methylation in the hours following CD8+ T cell activation, during a critical yet understudied temporal window. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification central to regulation of gene expression and directing immune responses. Our investigation spanned 96-h post-activation and unveils a nuanced tapestry of global and site-specific methylation changes. We identified 15,626 significant differentially methylated CpGs spread across the genome, with the most significant changes occurring within the genes ADAM10, ICA1, and LAPTM5. While many changes had modest effect sizes, approximately 120 CpGs exhibited a log2FC above 1.5, with cell activation and proliferation pathways the most affected. Relatively few of the differentially methylated CpGs occurred along adjacent gene regions. The exceptions were seven differentially methylated gene regions, with the Human T cell Receptor Alpha Joining Genes demonstrating consistent methylation change over a 3kb window. We also investigated whether an inflammatory environment could alter DNA methylation during activation, with proliferating cells exposed to the oxidant glycine chloramine. No substantial differential methylation was observed in this context. The temporal perspective of early activation adds depth to the evolving field of epigenetic immunology, offering insights with implications for therapeutic innovation and expanding our understanding of epigenetic modulation in immune function.">

        <tr id="Disease risk prediction based on genomic sequence and transcriptional profile can improve disease screening and prevention. Despite identifying many disease-associated DNA variants, distinguishing deleterious non-coding DNA variations remains poor for most common diseases. In this study, we designed in vitro experiments to uncover the significance of occupancy and competitive binding between P53 and cMYC on common target genes. Analyzing publicly available ChIP-seq data for P53 and cMYC in embryonic stem cells showed that ~344-366 regions are co-occupied, and on average, two cis-overlapping motifs (CisOMs) per region were identified, suggesting that co-occupancy is evolutionarily conserved. Using U2OS and Raji cells untreated and treated with doxorubicin to increase P53 protein level while potentially reducing cMYC level, ChIP-seq analysis illustrated that around 16 to 922 genomic regions were co-occupied by P53 and cMYC, and substitutions of cMYC signals by P53 were detected post doxorubicin treatment. Around 187 expressed genes near co-occupied regions were altered at mRNA level according to RNA-seq data analysis. We utilized a computational motif-matching approach to illustrate that changes in predicted P53 binding affinity in CisOMs of co-occupied elements significantly correlate with alterations in reporter gene expression. We performed a similar analysis using SNPs mapped in CisOMs for P53 and cMYC from ChIP-seq data, and expression of target genes from GTEx portal. We found significant correlation between change in cMYC-motif binding affinity in CisOMs and altered expression. Our study brings us closer to developing a generally applicable approach to filter etiological non-coding variations associated with common diseases.">

        <tr id="Cancer is a heterogeneous disease that results from genetic alteration of cell cycle and proliferation controls. Identifying mutations that drive cancer, understanding cancer type specificities, and delineating how driver mutations interact with each other to establish disease is vital for identifying therapeutic vulnerabilities. Such cancer specific patterns and gene co-occurrences can be identified by studying tumor genome sequences, and networks have proven effective in uncovering relationships between sequences. We present two network-based approaches to identify driver gene patterns among tumor samples. The first approach relies on analysis using the Directed Weighted All Nearest Neighbors (DiWANN) model, which is a variant of sequence similarity network, and the second approach uses bipartite network analysis. A data reduction framework was implemented to extract the minimal relevant information for the sequence similarity network analysis, where a transformed reference sequence is generated for constructing the driver gene network. This data reduction process combined with the efficiency of the DiWANN network model, greatly lowered the computational cost (in terms of execution time and memory usage) of generating the networks enabling us to work at a much larger scale than previously possible. The DiWANN network helped us identify cancer types in which samples were more closely connected to each other suggesting they are less heterogeneous and potentially susceptible to a common drug. The bipartite network analysis provided insight into gene associations and co-occurrences. We identified genes that were broadly mutated in multiple cancer types and mutations exclusive to only a few. Additionally, weighted one-mode gene projections of the bipartite networks revealed a pattern of occurrence of driver genes in different cancers. Our study demonstrates that network-based approaches can be an effective tool in cancer genomics. The analysis identifies co-occurring and exclusive driver genes and mutations for specific cancer types, providing a better understanding of the driver genes that lead to tumor initiation and evolution.">

        <tr id="Abstract Motivation Eukaryotic cells contain organelles called mitochondria that have their own genome. Most cells contain thousands of mitochondria which replicate, even in nondividing cells, by means of a relatively error-prone process resulting in somatic mutations in their genome. Because of the higher mutation rate compared to the nuclear genome, mitochondrial mutations have been used to track cellular lineage, particularly using single-cell sequencing that measures mitochondrial mutations in individual cells. However, existing methods to infer the cell lineage tree from mitochondrial mutations do not model “heteroplasmy,” which is the presence of multiple mitochondrial clones with distinct sets of mutations in an individual cell. Single-cell sequencing data thus provide a mixture of the mitochondrial clones in individual cells, with the ancestral relationships between these clones described by a mitochondrial clone tree. While deconvolution of somatic mutations from a mixture of evolutionarily related genomes has been extensively studied in the context of bulk sequencing of cancer tumor samples, the problem of mitochondrial deconvolution has the additional constraint that the mitochondrial clone tree must be concordant with the cell lineage tree. Results We formalize the problem of inferring a concordant pair of a mitochondrial clone tree and a cell lineage tree from single-cell sequencing data as the Nested Perfect Phylogeny Mixture (NPPM) problem. We derive a combinatorial characterization of the solutions to the NPPM problem, and formulate an algorithm, MERLIN, to solve this problem exactly using a mixed integer linear program. We show on simulated data that MERLIN outperforms existing methods that do not model mitochondrial heteroplasmy nor the concordance between the mitochondrial clone tree and the cell lineage tree. We use MERLIN to analyze single-cell whole-genome sequencing data of 5220 cells of a gastric cancer cell line and show that MERLIN infers a more biologically plausible cell lineage tree and mitochondrial clone tree compared to existing methods.

        <tr id="The p53 family remains a captivating focus of an extensive number of current studies. Accumulating evidence indicates that p53 abnormalities rank among the most prevalent in cancer. Given the numerous existing studies, which mostly focus on the mutations, expression profiles, and functional perturbations exhibited by members of the p53 family across diverse malignancies, this review will concentrate more on less explored facets regarding p53 activation and stabilization by the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in cancer, drawing on several studies. p53 integrates a broad spectrum of signals and is subject to diverse regulatory mechanisms to enact the necessary cellular response. It is widely acknowledged that each stage of p53 regulation, from synthesis to degradation, significantly influences its functionality in executing specific tasks. Over recent decades, a large body of data has established that mechanisms of regulation, closely linked with protein activation and stabilization, involve intricate interactions with various cellular components. These often transcend canonical regulatory pathways. This new knowledge has expanded from the regulation of genes themselves to epigenomics and proteomics, whereby interaction partners increase in number and complexity compared with earlier paradigms. Specifically, studies have recently shown the involvement of the NPC protein in such complex interactions, underscoring the further complexity of p53 regulation. Furthermore, we also discuss therapeutic strategies based on recent developments in this field in combination with established targeted therapies.">

Although these changes do not alter the sequence of the DNA, they are significant in determining the phenotype and inheritance of the genes. The impact of epigenetics on inherited diseases like Fragile X syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome emphasizes the significance of studying epigenetic dysregulation in disease pathology. The current review aims to investigate the role of epigenetic mechanisms in inherited diseases and to evaluate the utility of molecular diagnostic tools for epigenetic analysis in disease diagnosis. Case studies of diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Prader-Willi syndrome highlight the clinical relevance of epigenetic analysis in disease diagnosis and management. This research is conducted through an extensive analysis of recent literature to explore the epigenetic mechanisms underlying inherited diseases. Additionally, advanced molecular diagnostic techniques like droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), transposase-based bisulfite tagging, and data mining coupled with conventional experimental procedures. However, the intricate relationship between genetic and epigenetic factors and challenges related to inclined data need to be addressed. Future research endeavors to elucidate the role of epigenetic modifications in disease pathogenesis and develop strategies for personalized medicinal treatment and therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Zinc finger proteins (ZNF), a unique yet diverse group of proteins, play pivotal roles in fundamental cellular mechanisms including transcription regulation, chromatin remodeling, protein/RNA homeostasis, and DNA repair. Consequently, the mis regulation of ZNF proteins can result in a variety of human diseases, ranging from neurodevelopmental disorders to several cancers. Considering the promising results of DNA damage repair (DDR) inhibition in the clinic, as a therapeutic strategy for patients with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency, identifying other potential targetable DDR proteins as emerged vulnerabilities in resistant tumor cells is essential, especially when considering the burden of acquired drug resistance. Importantly, there are a growing number of studies identifying new ZNFs and revealing their significance in several DDR pathways, highlighting their great potential as new targets for DDR-inhibition therapy. Although, there are still many uncharacterized ZNF-containing proteins with unknown biological function. In this review, we highlight the major classes and observed biological functions of ZNF proteins in mammalian cells. We briefly introduce well-known and newly discovered ZNFs and describe their molecular roles and contributions to human health and disease, especially cancer. Finally, we discuss the significance of ZNFs in DNA repair mechanisms, their potential in cancer therapy and advances in exploiting ZNF proteins as future therapeutic targets for human disease.">

        <tr id="Access to DNA is the first level of control in regulating gene transcription, a control that is also critical for maintaining DNA integrity. Cellular senescence is characterized by profound transcriptional rearrangements and accumulation of DNA lesions. Here, we discovered an epigenetic complex between HDAC4 and HDAC1/HDAC2 that is involved in the erase of H2BK120 acetylation. The HDAC4/HDAC1/HDAC2 complex modulates the efficiency of DNA repair by homologous recombination, through dynamic deacetylation of H2BK120. Deficiency of HDAC4 leads to accumulation of H2BK120ac, impaired recruitment of BRCA1 and CtIP to the site of lesions, accumulation of damaged DNA and senescence. In senescent cells this complex is disassembled because of increased proteasomal degradation of HDAC4. Forced expression of HDAC4 during RAS-induced senescence reduces the genomic spread of γH2AX. It also affects H2BK120ac levels, which are increased in DNA-damaged regions that accumulate during RAS-induced senescence. In summary, degradation of HDAC4 during senescence causes the accumulation of damaged DNA and contributes to the activation of the transcriptional program controlled by super-enhancers that maintains senescence.">

        <tr id="Abstract The Fanconi anemia (FA) repair pathway governs repair of highly genotoxic DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and relies on translesion synthesis (TLS). TLS is facilitated by REV1 or site-specific monoubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (PCNA-Ub) at lysine 164 (K164). A PcnaK164R/K164R but not Rev1−/− mutation renders mammals hypersensitive to ICLs. Besides the FA pathway, alternative pathways have been associated with ICL repair (1, 2), though the decision making between those remains elusive. To study the dependence and relevance of PCNA-Ub in FA repair, we intercrossed PcnaK164R/+; Fancg−/+ mice. A combined mutation (PcnaK164R/K164R; Fancg−/−) was found embryonically lethal. RNA-seq of primary double-mutant (DM) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) revealed elevated levels of replication stress-induced checkpoints. To exclude stress-induced confounders, we utilized a Trp53 knock-down to obtain a model to study ICL repair in depth. Regarding ICL-induced cell toxicity, cell cycle arrest, and replication fork progression, single-mutant and DM MEFs were found equally sensitive, establishing PCNA-Ub to be critical for FA-ICL repair. Immunoprecipitation and spectrometry-based analysis revealed an unknown role of PCNA-Ub in excluding mismatch recognition complex MSH2/MSH6 from being recruited to ICLs. In conclusion, our results uncovered a dual function of PCNA-Ub in ICL repair, i.e. exclude MSH2/MSH6 recruitment to channel the ICL toward canonical FA repair, in addition to its established role in coordinating TLS opposite the unhooked ICL.">

        <tr id="Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children, yet few environmental risk factors have been identified. We previously found an association between early-life tobacco smoke exposure and frequency of somatic deletions of 8 leukemia driver genes among childhood ALL patients in the California Childhood Leukemia Study. To expand analysis genome-wide and examine potential mechanisms, we conducted tumor whole-genome sequencing in 35 ALL patients, including 18 with high prenatal tobacco exposure and 17 with low exposure as determined by established epigenetic biomarkers. High tobacco exposure patients had significantly more structural variants (P < .001) and deletions (P = .001) genome-wide than low exposure patients. Investigation of off-target RAG recombination revealed that 41% of deletions in the high tobacco exposure patients were putatively RAG-mediated (full RAG motif identified at one or both breakpoints) compared with only 21% in the low exposure group (P = .001). In a multilevel model, deletions in high tobacco exposure patients were 2.44-fold (95% CI:1.13–5.38) more likely to be putatively RAG-mediated than deletions in low exposure patients. No point mutational signatures were associated with prenatal tobacco exposure. Our findings suggest that early-life tobacco smoke exposure may promote leukemogenesis by driving development of somatic deletions in pre-leukemic lymphocytes via off-target RAG recombination.">

        <tr id="Phenotypic variation between malaria parasites is one of the major contributors to the pathogens success and is regulated by differences in heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing. Currently, the heterochromatin landscape is mostly profiled utilising chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq). However this technique has drawbacks regarding AT-content-related artifacts and requires substantial material and time investment, severely limiting profiling of scarce sample types (e.g. field isolates). In order to facilitate assessments of epigenetic states in low-input samples, we adopted the epigenetic profiling technique Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) to Plasmodium falciparum parasites. Performing the reaction with 100,000 or even only 10,000 nuclei yielded reproducible results coherent with bulk-ChIP-seq data while using significantly less material. We also optimised sample preparation, permitting the use of crude saponin lysates, which decreases sample loss due to inefficient nuclei isolation and increases versatility of the protocol. Finally, we developed DiBioCUT&Tag, a novel way of utilising dimerisation-induced recruitment of biotin ligases for signal amplification prior to anti-biotin CUT&Tag, which we successfully deployed to profile both heterochromatin occupancy and a dynamically chromatin-associated protein (BDP5). Methods described here hence provide substantially improved means for epigenetic profiling of (transiently) chromatin-associated proteins from low-input samples in the malaria parasite and beyond.">

        <tr id="The major histocompatibility (MHC) locus, also known as the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes, is located on the short arm of chromosome 6, and contains three regions (Class I, Class II and Class III). This 5 Mbp locus is one of the most variable regions of the human genome, yet it also encodes a set of highly conserved and important proteins related to immunological response. Genetic variations in this region are responsible for more diseases than in the entire rest of the human genome. However, information on local structural features of the DNA is largely ignored. With recent advances in long-read sequencing technology, it is now becoming possible to sequence the entire 5 Mbp MHC locus, producing complete diploid haplotypes of the whole region. Here, we describe structural maps based on the complete sequences from six different homozygous HLA cell lines. We find long-range structural variability in the different sequences for DNA stacking energy, position preference and curvature, variation in repeats, as well as more local changes in regions forming open chromatin structures, likely to influence gene expression levels. These structural maps can be useful in visualizing large scale structural variation across HLA types, in particular when this can be complemented with epigenetic signals.">

        <tr id="CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized genome engineering by allowing precise introductions of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, genome engineering in bacteria is still a complex, multi-step process requiring a donor DNA template for homology-directed repair of DSBs. Prime editing circumvents this need as the repair template is provided within the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA). Here, we developed make-or-break Prime Editing (mbPE) that allows for precise and effective genetic engineering in the opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. In contrast to traditional prime editing in which a nicking Cas9 is employed, mbPE harnesses wild type Cas9 in combination with a pegRNA that destroys the seed region or protospacer adjacent motif. Since most bacteria poorly perform template-independent end joining, correctly genome-edited clones are selectively enriched during mbPE. We show that mbPE can be used to introduce point mutations, deletions and targeted insertions, including protein tags such as a split luciferase, at selection efficiencies of over 93%. mbPE enables sequential genome editing, is scalable, and can be used to generate pools of mutants in a high-throughput manner. The mbPE system and pegRNA design guidelines described here will ameliorate future bacterial genome editing endeavors.">

        <tr id="Genome editing is poised to revolutionize treatment of genetic diseases, but poor understanding and control of DNA repair outcomes hinders its therapeutic potential. DNA repair is especially understudied in nondividing cells like neurons, which must withstand decades of DNA damage without replicating. This lack of knowledge limits the efficiency and precision of genome editing in clinically relevant cells. To address this, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neurons to examine how postmitotic human neurons repair Cas9-induced DNA damage. We discovered that neurons can take weeks to fully resolve this damage, compared to just days in isogenic iPSCs. Furthermore, Cas9-treated neurons upregulated unexpected DNA repair genes, including factors canonically associated with replication. Manipulating this response with chemical or genetic perturbations allowed us to direct neuronal repair toward desired editing outcomes. By studying DNA repair in postmitotic human cells, we uncovered unforeseen challenges and opportunities for precise therapeutic editing.">

These noncanonical structures can act as impediments to DNA polymerase progression along the duplex, thereby triggering DNA damage and ultimately jeopardizing genomic stability. Their stabilization by ad hoc ligands is currently being explored as a putative anticancer strategy since it might represent an efficient way to inflict toxic DNA damage specifically to rapidly dividing cancer cells. The relevance of this strategy is only emerging for three-way DNA junctions (TWJs) and, to date, no molecule has been recognized as a reference TWJ ligand, featuring both high affinity and selectivity. Herein, we characterize such reference ligands through a combination of in vitro techniques comprising affinity and selectivity assays (competitive FRET-melting and TWJ Screen assays), functional tests (qPCR and Taq stop assays), and structural analyses (molecular dynamics and NMR investigations). We identify novel azacryptands TrisNP-amphi and TrisNP-ana as the most promising ligands, interacting with TWJs with high affinity and selectivity. These ligands represent new molecular tools to investigate the cellular roles of TWJs and explore how they can be exploited in innovative anticancer therapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have enabled the precise decoding of genomes in non-model organisms, providing a basis for unraveling the patterns and mechanisms of sex chromosome evolution. Studies of different species have yielded conflicting results regarding the traditional theory that sex chromosomes evolve from autosomes via the accumulation of deleterious mutations and degeneration of the Y (or W) chromosome. The concept of the ‘sex chromosome cycle,’ emerging from this context, posits that at any stage of the cycle (i.e., differentiation, degeneration, or loss), sex chromosome turnover can occur while maintaining stable sex determination. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that drive both the persistence and turnover of sex chromosomes at each stage of the cycle is crucial. In this review, we integrate recent findings on the mechanisms underlying maintenance and turnover, with a special focus on several organisms having unique sex chromosomes. Our review suggests that the diversity of sex chromosomes in the maintenance of stable sex determination is underappreciated and emphasizes the need for more research on the sex chromosome cycle.">

To date, potent therapeutic approaches have been developed to eradicate tumor cells, but intolerable toxicity and drug resistance can occur in treated patients, limiting the efficiency of existing treatment strategies. Therefore, searching for novel genes critical for cancer progression and therapeutic response is urgently needed for successful cancer therapy. Recent advances in bioinformatics and proteomic techniques have allowed the identification of a novel category of peptides encoded by non-canonical open reading frames (ncORFs) from historically non-coding genomic regions. Surprisingly, many ncORFs express functional microproteins that play a vital role in human cancers. In this review, we provide a comprehensive description of different ncORF types with coding capacity and technological methods in discovering ncORFs among human genomes. We also summarize the carcinogenic role of ncORFs such as pTINCR and HOXB-AS3 in regulating hallmarks of cancer, as well as the roles of ncORFs such as HOXB-AS3 and CIP2A-BP in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. We also discuss how ncORFs such as AKT-174aa and DDUP are involved in anti-cancer drug response and the underestimated potential of ncORFs as therapeutic targets.">

It’s replication is a complex process that involves both DNA polymerases and a specialized enzyme called telomerase which is a ribonucleoprotein complex that synthesizes telomeric DNA by using an internal RNA template. However, telomerase alone cannot fully replicate the telomeric DNA, and requires the cooperation of other factors, such as shelterin, CST, and DNA repair proteins. Telomere replication is tightly regulated by various mechanisms, such as cell cycle checkpoints, telomere length homeostasis, and telomere position effect and dysregulation of it can lead to genomic instability, cellular senescence, and cancer.

        <tr id="Meiotic errors of relatively small chromosomes in oocytes result in egg aneuploidies that cause miscarriages and congenital diseases. Unlike somatic cells, which preferentially mis-segregate larger chromosomes, aged oocytes preferentially mis-segregate smaller chromosomes through unclear processes. Here, we provide a comprehensive three-dimensional chromosome identifying-and-tracking dataset throughout meiosis I in live mouse oocytes. This analysis reveals a prometaphase pathway that actively moves smaller chromosomes to the inner region of the metaphase plate. In the inner region, chromosomes are pulled by stronger bipolar microtubule forces, which facilitates premature chromosome separation, a major cause of segregation errors in aged oocytes. This study reveals a spatial pathway that facilitates aneuploidy of small chromosomes preferentially in aged eggs and implicates the role of the M phase in creating a chromosome size–based spatial arrangement. Editor’s summary Chromosome segregation errors in oocytes lead to aneuploidy in eggs, a major cause of miscarriage and congenital disease. Errors are more likely to occur with age, especially with smaller chromosomes, but the reasons for this pattern are poorly understood. Takenouchi et al. established a method to identify and track targeted chromosomes throughout meiosis in live mouse oocytes. This method revealed that smaller chromosomes actively move toward the inner region of the spindle equator, creating a chromosome size–based spatial arrangement on the metaphase plate. Inner positioning of smaller chromosomes increases the risk of their premature separation, a hallmark of aging-associated errors in oocytes. —Di Jiang INTRODUCTION Chromosome segregation errors during meiosis in oocytes lead to aneuploidy in eggs. The frequency of errors increases with maternal age. Unlike somatic cells, in which larger chromosomes are more likely to be mis-segregated, aged oocytes exhibit segregation errors preferentially in smaller chromosomes. Egg aneuploidy in a small chromosome is a major cause of miscarriage and congenital diseases such as Down syndrome. How smaller chromosomes are preferentially mis-segregated in aged oocytes is poorly understood. RATIONALE To study individual chromosome dynamics, we developed a comprehensive set of fluorescent probes that specifically label each of the 20 mouse chromosomes (19 autosomes and the X chromosome). Using these probes, we established a live imaging pipeline for complete three-dimensional (3D) tracking of identified chromosomes throughout meiosis in mouse oocytes. This “chromosome identifying-and-tracking” pipeline allowed us to acquire 217 complete 3D trajectories of nine different identified chromosomes and their kinetochores from 93 oocytes. Using this comprehensive dataset, we aimed to quantitatively analyze chromosome size–based spatiotemporal dynamics and test whether they contribute to preferential errors of smaller chromosomes. RESULTS Quantitative analysis revealed that smaller chromosomes prefer to move toward the inner region of the spindle equator during prometaphase, although each chromosome exhibits substantial variability in its dynamics among oocytes. This preference of smaller chromosomes leads to the establishment of a chromosome size–based spatial arrangement, in which smaller chromosomes are preferentially positioned in the inner region of the metaphase plate, in both mouse and human oocytes. Oocytes can establish the chromosome size–based spatial arrangement without the need for a preexisting chromosome positioning bias, demonstrating the existence of a prometaphase pathway that actively creates the spatial arrangement. We found that smaller chromosomes tend to stretch earlier and that stretching is coupled with inward movement more tightly in smaller chromosomes, suggesting that the prometaphase pathway involves earlier bipolar microtubule attachment on smaller chromosomes. The prometaphase pathway is active independent of age. Chromosome tracking in aged mouse oocytes showed that premature chromosome separation—which is due to aging-associated reduction of chromosome cohesion and a major cause of segregation errors—occurs predominantly in the inner region of the metaphase plate. Premature chromosome separation depends on bipolar microtubule pulling forces, which we found to be significantly stronger in the inner region of the metaphase plate, as indicated by increased kinetochore-centromere distances. Preventing the inner positioning of smaller chromosomes with artificial beads significantly suppresses premature chromosome separation in aged oocytes during prolonged metaphase, demonstrating that preferential inner positioning of smaller chromosomes is a risk of segregation errors in aged oocytes. CONCLUSION This study shows that mammalian oocytes possess the prometaphase pathway that preferentially positions smaller chromosomes in the inner region of the metaphase plate, which puts them at risk of segregation errors when chromosome cohesion is weakened by aging. The chromosome size–based 2D radial arrangement created by the prometaphase pathway is similar to the 3D chromosome territory arrangement observed in the interphase nucleus of somatic cells, providing insights into the role of M phase in establishing nuclear-chromosome arrangement. Spatial pathway to meiotic errors. Smaller chromosomes preferentially move toward the inner region of the metaphase plate, creating a chromosome size–based spatial arrangement. In the inner region, microtubule bipolar forces are stronger, facilitating premature chromosome separation, a major cause of aging-associated egg aneuploidy.

        <tr id="CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is an insulator protein that binds to a highly conserved DNA motif and facilitates regulation of three-dimensional (3D) nuclear architecture and transcription. CTCF binding sites (CTCF-BSs) reside in non-coding DNA and are frequently mutated in cancer. Our previous study identified a small subclass of CTCF-BSs that are resistant to CTCF knock down, termed persistent CTCF binding sites (P-CTCF-BSs). P-CTCF-BSs show high binding conservation and potentially regulate cell-type constitutive 3D chromatin architecture. Here, using ICGC sequencing data we made the striking observation that P-CTCF-BSs display a highly elevated mutation rate in breast and prostate cancer when compared to all CTCF-BSs. To address whether P-CTCF-BS mutations are also enriched in other cell-types, we developed CTCF-INSITE-a tool utilising machine learning to predict persistence based on genetic and epigenetic features of experimentally-determined P-CTCF-BSs. Notably, predicted P-CTCF-BSs also show a significantly elevated mutational burden in all 12 cancer-types tested. Enrichment was even stronger for P-CTCF-BS mutations with predicted functional impact to CTCF binding and chromatin looping. Using in vitro binding assays we validated that P-CTCF-BS cancer mutations, predicted to be disruptive, indeed reduced CTCF binding. Together this study reveals a new subclass of cancer specific CTCF-BS DNA mutations and provides insights into their importance in genome organization in a pan-cancer setting.">

The DNA damage repair (DDR) protein topoisomerase I (TOP1) has been linked to various cancers, yet its distinct roles and mechanisms in CC are not fully elucidated.Methods: We investigated TOP1 expression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and CC tissues utilizing qRT-PCR and IHC, correlating findings with patient prognosis. Subsequent knockdown studies were performed in vitro and in vivo to evaluate the influence of TOP1 on tumor growth, DNA repair, and inflammatory responses.Results: TOP1 was highly expressed in CIN and CC, negatively correlating with patient prognosis. Inhibition of TOP1 impeded CC cell growth and disrupted DNA repair. TOP1 was shown to regulate tumor-promoting inflammation and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) production in a cGAS-dependent manner. HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 upregulated TOP1 and activated the cGAS-PD-L1 pathway.Conclusions: TOP1 acts as a DNA repair mediator, promoting CC development and immune evasion. Targeting the TOP1-cGAS-PD-L1 axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for CC.">

        <tr id="Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a widely used method for classifying cell types and states and revealing disease mechanisms. However, most contemporary scRNA-seq platforms fail to explore the multi-landscape of RNA. Here, we designed a microfluidic chip combined oligo-dT primers and Random Bridging Co-labeling (RBCL) RNA sequencing to develop an innovative Chigene scRNA-seq technology that can identify gene expression, mutations, and RNA splicing landscapes at the single-cell level. The Chigene scRNA-seq platform demonstrated exceptional performance, with minimal doublet rates of 0.94% (Chigene V1) and 1.93% (Chigene V2). Both versions exhibit high sensitivity, with Chigene V2 achieving nearly 100% RNA coverage and detecting over 1800 genes per cell on average. Targeted capture of single-cell gene mutations enhances mutation detection sensitivity. Moreover, this Chigene V2 platform has been validated in clinical samples for its ability to detect mutations, gene fusions and alternative splicing. The reliability of the platform was further corroborated using known functional gene mutation (CDKN1A) and fusion (FGFR3-TACC). To validate this method’s potential for discovering novel gene mutations in clinical samples, our investigation revealed an intriguing cell subpopulation carrying an ARHGAP5 mutation in urothelial carcinoma. These cells exhibited high-frequency mRNA splicing and exhibited specific crosstalk with T cells, distinguishing them from the subpopulation with the ARHGAP5 wild-type phenotype. Overall, this method provides a robust scRNA-seq platform suitable for comprehensive analyses of clinical specimens at different genetic information levels, thereby offering significant potential in the discovery of novel genes and interactions at the single-cell level.">

        <tr id="Single-strand breaks (SSBs) are one of the most common endogenous lesions and have the potential to give rise to cytotoxic double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication. To investigate the mechanism of replication fork collapse at SSBs and subsequent repair, we employed Cas9 nickase (nCas9) to generate site and strand-specific nicks in the budding yeast genome. We show that nCas9-induced nicks are converted to mostly double-ended DSBs during S-phase. We find that repair of replication-dependent DSBs requires homologous recombination (HR) and is independent of canonical non-homologous end joining. Consistent with a strong bias to repair these lesions using a sister chromatid template, we observe minimal induction of inter-chromosomal HR by nCas9. Using nCas9 and a gRNA to nick either the leading or lagging strand template, we carried out a genome-wide screen to identify factors necessary for the repair of replication-dependent DSBs. All the core HR genes were recovered in the screen with both gRNAs, but we recovered components of the replication-coupled nucleosome assembly (RCNA) pathway with only the gRNA targeting the leading strand template. By use of additional gRNAs, we find that the RCNA pathway is especially important to repair a leading strand fork collapse.">

Elucidation of the epigenetic underpinnings of these subtypes could provide important insights into the drivers of therapy resistance. In this study, we produced chromatin accessibility maps linked to the binding of lineage-specific transcription factors (TF) by performing ATAC sequencing on 70 mCRPC tissue biopsies integrated with transcriptome and whole genome sequencing. mCRPC had a distinct global chromatin accessibility profile linked to AR function. Analysis of TF occupancy across accessible chromatin revealed 203 TFs associated with mCRPC subtypes. Notably, ZNF263 was identified as a putative prostate cancer TF with a significant impact on gene activity in the double-negative (AR- neuroendocrine-) subtype, potentially activating MYC targets. Overall, this analysis of chromatin accessibility in mCRPC provides valuable insights into epigenetic changes that occur during progression to mCRPC.">

        <tr id="Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a mechanism of DNA damage tolerance utilized by eukaryotic cells to replicate DNA across lesions that impede the high-fidelity replication machinery. In TLS, a series of specialized DNA polymerases are employed, which recognize specific DNA lesions, insert nucleotides across the damage, and extend the distorted primer-template. This allows cells to preserve genetic integrity at the cost of mutations. In humans, TLS enzymes include the Y-family, inserter polymerases, Polη, Polι, Polκ, Rev1, and the B-family extender polymerase Polζ, while in S. cerevisiae only Polη, Rev1, and Polζ are present. To bypass DNA lesions, TLS polymerases cooperate, assembling into a complex on the eukaryotic sliding clamp, PCNA, termed the TLS mutasome. The mutasome assembly is contingent on protein–protein interactions (PPIs) between the modular domains and subunits of TLS enzymes, and their interactions with PCNA and DNA. While the structural mechanisms of DNA lesion bypass by the TLS polymerases and PPIs of their individual modules are well understood, the mechanisms by which they cooperate in the context of TLS complexes have remained elusive. This review focuses on structural studies of TLS polymerases and describes the case of TLS holoenzyme assemblies in action emerging from recent high-resolution Cryo-EM studies.">

        <tr id="Endometrial cancer (EC) is a devastating and common disease affecting women’s health. The NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program predicted that there would be >66,000 new cases in the United States and >13,000 deaths from EC in 2023, and EC is the sixth most common cancer among women worldwide. Regulation of mitochondrial metabolism plays a role in tumorigenesis. In proliferating cancer cells, mitochondria provide the necessary building blocks for biosynthesis of amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, and glucose. One mechanism causing altered mitochondrial activity is mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation. The polyploid human mtDNA genome is a circular double-stranded molecule essential to vertebrate life that harbors genes critical for oxidative phosphorylation plus mitochondrial-derived peptide genes. Cancer cells display aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, which arises from the needs of fast-dividing cells and is characterized by increased glucose uptake and conversion of glucose to lactate. Solid tumors often contain at least one mtDNA substitution. Furthermore, it is common for cancer cells to harbor mixtures of wild-type and mutant mtDNA genotypes, known as heteroplasmy. Considering the increase in cancer cell energy demand, the presence of functionally relevant carcinogenesis-inducing or environment-adapting mtDNA mutations in cancer seems plausible. We review 279 EC tumor-specific mtDNA single nucleotide variants from 111 individuals from different studies. Many transition mutations indicative of error-prone DNA polymerase γ replication and C to U deamination events were present. We examine the spectrum of mutations and their heteroplasmy and discuss the potential biological impact of recurrent, non-synonymous, insertion, and deletion mutations. Lastly, we explore current EC treatments, exploiting cancer cell mitochondria for therapy and the prospect of using mtDNA variants as an EC biomarker.">

        <tr id="Horizontal gene transfer is a key driver of bacterial evolution, but it also presents severe risks to bacteria by introducing invasive mobile genetic elements. To counter these threats, bacteria have developed various defense systems, including prokaryotic Argonautes (pAgo) and the DNA Defense Module DdmDE system. Through biochemical analysis, structural determination, and in vivo plasmid clearance assays, we elucidate the assembly and activation mechanisms of DdmDE, which eliminates small, multicopy plasmids. We demonstrate that DdmE, a pAgo-like protein, acts as a catalytically inactive, DNA-guided, DNA-targeting defense module. In the presence of guide DNA, DdmE targets plasmids and recruits a dimeric DdmD, which contains nuclease and helicase domains. Upon binding to DNA substrates, DdmD transitions from an autoinhibited dimer to an active monomer, which then translocates along and cleaves the plasmids. Together, our findings reveal the intricate mechanisms underlying DdmDE-mediated plasmid clearance, offering fundamental insights into bacterial defense systems against plasmid invasions.">

        <tr id="Recent exome-wide association studies have explored the role of coding variants in breast cancer risk, highlighting the role of rare variants in multiple genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM and PALB2, as well as new susceptibility genes e.g., MAP3K1. These genes, however, explain a small proportion of the missing heritability of the disease. Much of the missing heritability likely lies in the non-coding genome. We evaluated the role of rare variants in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of 18,676 genes, and 35,201 putative promoter regions, using whole-genome sequencing data from UK Biobank on 8,001 women with breast cancer and 92,534 women without breast cancer. Burden tests and SKAT-O tests were performed in UTR and promoter regions. For UTR regions of 35 putative breast cancer susceptibility genes, we additionally performed a meta-analysis with a large breast cancer case-control dataset. Associations for 8 regions at P<0.0001 were identified, including several with known roles in tumorigenesis. The strongest evidence of association was for variants in the 5' UTR of CDK5R1 (P=8.5x10-7). These results highlight the potential role of non-coding regulatory regions in breast cancer susceptibility.">

        <tr id="Retinoblastoma, a pediatric ocular malignancy, presents significant challenges in comprehending its molecular underpinnings and targeted therapeutic approaches. The dysregulated activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs) has been associated with retinoblastoma pathogenesis, influencing critical cellular processes like cell cycle regulation or retinal ganglion cell apoptosis. Through their deacetylase activity, HDACs exert control over key tumor suppressors and oncogenes, influencing the delicate equilibrium between proliferation and cell death. Furthermore, the interplay between HDACs and the retinoblastoma protein pathway, a pivotal aspect of retinoblastoma etiology, reveals a complex network of interactions influencing the tumor microenvironment. The examination of HDAC inhibitors, encompassing both established and novel compounds, offers insights into potential approaches to restore acetylation balance and impede retinoblastoma progression. Moreover, the identification of specific HDAC isoforms exhibiting varying expression in retinoblastoma provides avenues for personalized therapeutic strategies, allowing for interventions tailored to individual patient profiles. This review focuses on the intricate interrelationship between HDACs and retinoblastoma, shedding light on epigenetic mechanisms that control tumor development and progression. The exploration of HDAC-targeted therapies underscores the potential for innovative treatment modalities in the pursuit of more efficacious and personalized management strategies for this disease.">

        <tr id="The use of k-mers to capture genetic variation in bacterial genome-wide association studies (bGWAS) has demonstrated its effectiveness in overcoming the plasticity of bacterial genomes by providing a comprehensive array of genetic variants in a genome set that is not confined to a single reference genome. However, little attempt has been made to interpret k-mers in the context of genome rearrangements, partly due to challenges in the exhaustive and high-throughput identification of genome structure and individual rearrangement events. Here, we present GWarrange, a pre- and post-bGWAS processing methodology that leverages the unique properties of k-mers to facilitate bGWAS for genome rearrangements. Repeat sequences are common instigators of genome rearrangements through intragenomic homologous recombination, and they are commonly found at rearrangement boundaries. Using whole-genome sequences, repeat sequences are replaced by short placeholder sequences, allowing the regions flanking repeats to be incorporated into relatively short k-mers. Then, locations of flanking regions in significant k-mers are mapped back to complete genome sequences to visualise genome rearrangements. Four case studies based on two bacterial species (Bordetella pertussis and Enterococcus faecium) and a simulated genome set are presented to demonstrate the ability to identify phenotype-associated rearrangements. GWarrange is available at https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/GWarrange.">

        <tr id="Abstract The DNA‐dependent protein kinase (DNA‐PK), catalytic subunit, also known as DNA‐PKcs, is complexed with the heterodimer Ku70/Ku80 to form DNA‐PK holoenzyme, which is well recognized as initiator in the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair after double strand break (DSB). During NHEJ, DNA‐PKcs is essential for both DNA end processing and end joining. Besides its classical function in DSB repair, DNA‐PKcs also shows multifaceted functions in various biological activities such as class switch recombination (CSR) and variable (V) diversity (D) joining (J) recombination in B/T lymphocytes development, innate immunity through cGAS–STING pathway, transcription, alternative splicing, and so on, which are dependent on its function in NHEJ or not. Moreover, DNA‐PKcs deficiency has been proven to be related with human diseases such as neurological pathogenesis, cancer, immunological disorder, and so on through different mechanisms. Therefore, it is imperative to summarize the latest findings about DNA‐PKcs and diseases for better targeting DNA‐PKcs, which have shown efficacy in cancer treatment in preclinical models. Here, we discuss the multifaceted roles of DNA‐PKcs in human diseases, meanwhile, we discuss the progresses of DNA‐PKcs inhibitors and their potential in clinical trials. The most updated review about DNA‐PKcs will hopefully provide insights and ideas to understand DNA‐PKcs associated diseases.">

        <tr id="Endothelial cells (ECs) maintain vessel tone and barrier integrity, regulate blood homeostasis, and prevent the extravasation of leukocytes under normal physiological conditions. Because of the limited lifespans and batch-to-batch differences with respect to the genetic make-up of primary ECs, established immortal EC lines are extensively used for studying endothelial biology. To address this issue, the immortal endothelial cell line EA.hy926 was developed by fusing primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with human lung carcinoma A549 cells. EA.hy926 cells share a number of similar endothelial properties with HUVECs and are considered the immortal counterpart to primary HUVECs. However, the cytogenetic integrity of EA.hy926 cells is not fully elucidated. We characterized EA.hy926 cells with conventional G-banding and molecular cytogenetic techniques such as spectral karyotyping and subtelomeric fluorescence in situ hybridization. Cytogenetic analysis revealed an array of numerical and stable structural chromosomal rearrangements including one deletion, one duplication, one isochromosome, seven simple translocations, and five complex translocations in Ea.hy926 cells. These findings will advance comprehension of EA.hy926 cell biology and augment future endothelial studies, specifically in comparison studies between HUVECs and EA.hy926 cells.">

        <tr id="DNA condensates, formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), emerge as promising soft matter assemblies for creating artificial cells. The advantages of DNA condensates are their molecular permeability through the surface due to their membrane-less structure and their fluidic property. However, they face challenges in the design of their surface, e.g., unintended fusion and less regulation of permeable molecules. Addressing them, we report surface modification of DNA condensates with DNA origami nanoparticles, employing a Pickering-emulsion strategy. We successfully constructed core-shell structures with DNA origami coatings on DNA condensates and further enhanced the condensate stability toward fusion via connecting DNA origamis by responding to DNA input strands. The 'armoring' prevented the fusion of DNA condensates, enabling the formation of multicellular-like structures of DNA condensates. Moreover, the permeability was altered through the state change from coating to armoring the DNA condensates. The armored DNA condensates have significant potential for constructing artificial cells, offering increased surface stability and selective permeability for small molecules while maintaining compartmentalized space and multicellular organization.">

        <tr id="Aneuploidy is nearly ubiquitous in tumor genomes, but the role of aneuploidy in the early stages of cancer evolution remains unclear. Here, by inducing heterogeneous aneuploidy in non-transformed human colon organoids (colonoids), we investigated how the effects of aneuploidy on cell growth and differentiation may promote malignant transformation. Previous work implicated p53 activation as a downstream response to aneuploidy induction. We found that simple aneuploidy, characterized by 1-3 gained or lost chromosomes, resulted in little or modest p53 activation and cell cycle arrest when compared with more complex aneuploid cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the degree of p53 activation was strongly correlated with karyotype complexity. Single-cell tracking showed that cells could continue to divide despite the observation of one to a few lagging chromosomes. Unexpectedly, colonoids with simple aneuploidy exhibited impaired differentiation after niche factor withdrawal. These findings demonstrate that simple aneuploid cells can escape p53 surveillance and may contribute to niche factor-independent growth of cancer-initiating colon stem cells. [Media: see text].">

        <tr id="Motivation By accounting for variants within measured transcripts, it is possible to evaluate the status of somatic variants using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and to characterize their clonality. However, the sparsity (very few reads per transcript) or bias in protocols (favoring 3’ ends of the transcripts) makes the chance of capturing somatic variants very unlikely. This can be overcome by targeted sequencing or the use of mitochondrial variants as natural barcodes for clone identification. Currently, available computational tools focus on genotyping, but do not provide functionality for combined analysis of somatic and mitochondrial variants and functional analysis such as characterization of gene expression changes in detected clones. Results Here, we propose SIGURD, which is an R-based pipeline for the clonal analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. This allows the quantification of clones by leveraging both somatic and mitochondrial variants. SIGURD also allows for functional analysis after clonal detection: association of clones with cell populations, detection of differentially expressed genes across clones and association of somatic and mitochondrial variants. Here, we demonstrate the power of SIGURD by analyzing single-cell data of colony-forming cells derived from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.

CRISPR-Cas9, -Cas12 and related proteins use guide RNAs to recognize ∼20-nucleotide target sites within genomic DNA by mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. We used structural and biochemical methods to assess early steps in DNA recognition by Cas12a protein-guide RNA complexes. We show here that Cas12a initiates DNA target recognition by bending DNA to induce transient nucleotide flipping that exposes nucleobases for DNA-RNA hybridization. Cryo-EM structural analysis of a trapped Cas12a-RNA-DNA surveillance complex and fluorescence-based conformational probing show that Cas12a-induced DNA helix destabilization enables target discovery and engagement. This mechanism of initial DNA interrogation resembles that of CRISPR-Cas9 despite distinct evolutionary origins and different RNA-DNA hybridization directionality of these enzyme families.

        <tr id="Cancer is one of the main reasons for death, and it threatens human life and health. Both the environment and genes can lead to cancers. It dates back more than a million years; more importantly, tumor cells can not be detected until they grow to a large number. Currently, cancers are treated with surgical excision or non-surgical procedures. By studying the interaction between ncRNAs and PKM2, we aim to provide new targets for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis for cancers. Read relevant articles and made a summary and classification. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are RNAs that do not code for proteins. They perform a function in transcription and translation and can be used as targets for cancer therapy. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a form of PKM, and it catalyzes the glycolysis of the final cellular processes to promote tumorigenesis. Not only that, but it also plays non-metabolic functions, including the expression of the gene, cell proliferation, cell migration, and tumor angiogenesis in cancer cells. The existing studies have found that microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) can promote or inhibit the aerobic glycolysis of cancer cells by affecting PKM2, which increases or decrease the risk of cancers and affect the progression of cancers. This review focuses on the mechanism of ncRNAs regulating PKM2 in cancers and summarizes the roles of some ncRNAs.">

        <tr id="The Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1-like (CHD1L) is a nucleosome remodeling enzyme, which plays a key role in chromatin relaxation during the DNA damage response. Genome editing has shown that deletion of CHD1L sensitizes cells to PARPi, but the effect of its pharmacological inhibition has not been defined. Triple-negative breast cancer SUM149PT, HCC1937, and MDA-MB-231 cells were used to assess the mechanism of action of the CHD1Li OTI-611. Cytotoxicity as a single agent or in combination with standard-of-care treatments was assessed in tumor organoids. Immunofluorescence was used to assess the translocation of PAR and AIF to the cytoplasm or the nucleus and to study markers of DNA damage or apoptosis. Trapping of PARP1/2 or CHD1L onto chromatin was also assessed by in situ subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence and validated by Western blot. We show that the inhibition of CHD1L’s ATPase activity by OTI-611 is cytotoxic to triple-negative breast cancer tumor organoids and synergizes with PARPi and chemotherapy independently of the BRCA mutation status. The inhibition of the remodeling function blocks the phosphorylation of H2AX, traps CHD1L on chromatin, and leaves PAR chains on PARP1/2 open for hydrolysis. PAR hydrolysis traps PARP1/2 at DNA damage sites and mediates PAR translocation to the cytoplasm, release of AIF from the mitochondria, and induction of PARthanatos. The targeted inhibition of CHD1L’s oncogenic function by OTI-611 signifies an innovative therapeutic strategy for breast cancer and other cancers. This approach capitalizes on CHD1L-mediated DNA repair and cell survival vulnerabilities, thereby creating synergy with standard-of-care therapies">

        <tr id="Maintenance of DNA integrity is essential to all forms of life. DNA damage generated by reaction with genotoxic chemicals results in deleterious mutations, genome instability, and cell death. Pathogenic bacteria encounter several genotoxic agents during infection. In keeping with this, the loss of DNA repair networks results in virulence attenuation in several bacterial species. Interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICLs) are a type of DNA lesion formed by covalent linkage of opposing DNA strands and are particularly toxic as they interfere with replication and transcription. Bacteria have evolved specialized DNA glycosylases that unhook ICLs, thereby initiating their repair. In this study, we describe AlkX, a DNA glycosylase encoded by the multidrug resistant pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii. AlkX exhibits ICL unhooking activity similar to that of its Escherichia coli homolog YcaQ. Interrogation of the in vivo role of AlkX revealed that its loss sensitizes cells to DNA crosslinking and impairs A. baumannii colonization of the lungs and dissemination to distal tissues during pneumonia. These results suggest that AlkX participates in A. baumannii pathogenesis and protects the bacterium from stress conditions encountered in vivo. Consistent with this, we found that acidic pH, an environment encountered during host colonization, results in A. baumannii DNA damage and that alkX is induced by, and contributes to, defense against acidic conditions. Collectively, these studies reveal functions for a recently described class of proteins encoded in a broad range of pathogenic bacterial species.">

        <tr id="Skeletal muscle, the largest human organ by weight, is relevant to several polygenic metabolic traits and diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D). Identifying genetic mechanisms underlying these traits requires pinpointing the relevant cell types, regulatory elements, target genes, and causal variants. Here, we used genetic multiplexing to generate population-scale single nucleus (sn) chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq) and transcriptome (snRNA-seq) maps across 287 frozen human skeletal muscle biopsies representing 456,880 nuclei. We identified 13 cell types that collectively represented 983,155 ATAC summits, cataloging caQTL peaks that atlas-level snATAC maps often miss. We integrated genetic variation to discover 6,866 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and 100,928 chromatin accessibility QTL (caQTL) (5% FDR) across the five cell types. We identified 1,973 eGenes colocalized with caQTL and used mediation analyses to construct causal directional maps for chromatin accessibility and gene expression. 3,378 genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals across 43 relevant traits colocalized with sn-e/caQTL, 52% in a cell-specific manner. 77% of GWAS signals colocalized with caQTL and not eQTL, highlighting the critical importance of population-scale chromatin profiling for GWAS functional studies. A C2CD4A/B T2D GWAS signal colocalized with caQTL in muscle fibers and multiple chromatin loop models nominated VPS13C, a glucose uptake gene. Sequence of the caQTL peak overlapping caSNP rs7163757 showed allelic regulatory activity differences in a human myocyte cell line massively parallel reporter assay. These results illuminate the genetic regulatory architecture of human skeletal muscle at high-resolution epigenomic, transcriptomic, and cell state scales and serve as a template for population-scale multi-omic mapping in complex tissues and traits.

        <tr id="Abstract Background The methyltransferase SETD2 was originally identified as a tumor suppressor in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and ccRCC with SETD2 mutations have increased metastatic potential and poor progression free survival. A known epigenetic regulator, SETD2 interacts with actively transcribing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and tri-methylates Histone 3 at Lysine 36 (H3K36me3), a modification that correlates with active gene transcription and is recognized by mRNA methylation and splicing factors. Despite these known roles in mRNA transcription, loss of SETD2 does not alter genic transcription, raising the question of whether or how SETD2 regulates RNA biology. Methods Given that SETD2 influences RNA processing, we sought to identify RNA-protein complexes that are regulated by SETD2. To do this in an unbiased and high-throughput manner, we used orthogonal organic phase separation (OOPS) coupled with mass spectrometry to identify changes in RNA binding proteins and pathways between control and SETD2-knockout cells. Results Corroborating previous findings, we identified that RNA binding proteins governing mRNA splicing and cellular metabolism were dysregulated in SETD2 mutant cells. However, the most robust changes in SETD2 knockout cells occurred in pathways regulated ribosome biogenesis (See Figure, orange highlights), resulting in a significant decrease in binding of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing factors to RNA. We confirm these alterations lead to defects in rRNA transcription, processing, and ribosome biogenesis. We identify that loss of SETD2 catalytic activity phenocopies these rRNA processing defects, suggesting H3K36me3 is essential for rRNA processing. Disruptions occur to both the large (60S) and small (40S) ribosome subunits, modifying protein translation. Lastly, we identify synthetic lethality between SETD2 deletion or inhibition and small molecules that interfere with rRNA transcription. Conclusions While the majority of research emphasizes the role SETD2 in the regulation of mRNA, our data identify that SETD2 and its catalytic activity play a critical role in the transcription and processing of rRNA. Importantly, rRNA comprises 80-90% of cellular RNA yet is typically overlooked and understudied. Next-generation RNA sequencing or transcriptional assays investigate mRNA or genic transcription while ignoring rRNA, demonstrating why SETD2-mediated rRNA processing has been unexplored. This may also have important implications for prospective clinical trials that utilized RNA-sequencing to identify optimal therapeutic regimens. Our work also identified that SETD2-mutated cells are more sensitive to compounds that inhibit rRNA transcription, potentially uncovering a new therapeutic vulnerability of ccRCC with mono- and bi-allelic loss of SETD2. Alterations in ribosome biogenesis leads to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in many tumor types, and our future goal will be to investigate the role of ribosomes and rRNA transcription in transformation and metastasis in ccRCC as well as the molecular mechanisms connecting SETD2 to ribosome fidelity.

        <tr id="The co-occurrence of chromosome 10 loss and chromosome 7 gain in gliomas is the most frequent loss-gain co-aneuploidy pair in human cancers. This phenomenon has been investigated since the late 1980s without resolution. Expanding beyond previous gene-centric studies, we investigated the co-occurrence in a genome-wide manner taking an evolutionary perspective. Mining of large-scale tumor aneuploidy data confirmed the previous finding of a small-scale longitudinal study that the most likely order is chromosome 10 loss followed by chromosome 7 gain. Extensive analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data from both patients and cell lines revealed that this co-occurrence can be explained by functional rescue interactions that are highly enriched on chromosome 7, which could potentially compensate for any detrimental consequences arising from the loss of chromosome 10. Transcriptomic data from various normal, non-cancerous human brain tissues were analyzed to assess which tissues may be most predisposed to tolerate compensation of chromosome 10 loss by chromosome 7 gain. The analysis indicated that the pre-existing transcriptomic states in the cortex and frontal cortex, where gliomas arise, are more favorable than other brain regions for compensation by rescuer genes that are active on chromosome 7. Collectively, these findings suggest that the phenomenon of chromosome 10 loss and chromosome 7 gain in gliomas is orchestrated by a complex interaction of many genes residing within these two chromosomes and provide a plausible reason why this co-occurrence happens preferentially in cancers originating in certain regions of the brain.">

        <tr id="The ability to deliver large transgenes to a single genomic sequence with high efficiency would accelerate biomedical interventions. Current methods suffer from low insertion efficiency and most rely on undesired double-strand DNA breaks. Serine integrases catalyze the insertion of large DNA cargos at attachment (att) sites. By targeting att sites to the genome using technologies such as prime editing, integrases can target safe loci while avoiding double-strand breaks. We developed a method of phage-assisted continuous evolution we call IntePACE, that we used to rapidly perform hundreds of rounds of mutagenesis to systematically improve activity of PhiC31 and Bxb1 serine integrases. Novel hyperactive mutants were generated by combining synergistic mutations resulting in integration of a multi-gene cargo at rates as high as 80% of target chromosomes. Hyperactive integrases inserted a 15.7 kb therapeutic DNA cargo containing Von Willebrand Factor. This technology could accelerate gene delivery therapeutics and our directed evolution strategy can easily be adapted to improve novel integrases from nature.">

        <tr id="Gene conversions are broadly defined as the transfer of genetic material from a ‘donor’ to an ‘acceptor’ sequence and can happen both in meiosis and mitosis. They are a subset of non-crossover events and like crossover events, gene conversion can generate new combinations of alleles, erode linkage disequilibrium, and even counteract the mutation load by reverting germline mutations through GC-biased gene conversion. Estimating the rate of gene conversion and the distribution of gene conversion tract lengths remains challenging. Here, we present a new method for estimating tract length, rate and detection probability of non-crossover events directly in HiFi PacBio long read data. The method can be applied with data from a single individual, is unbiased even under low single nucleotide variant densities and does not necessitate any demographic or evolutionary assumptions. We apply the method to gene conversion events observed directly in Pacbio HiFI read data from a human sperm sample and find that human gene conversion tracts are shorter (mean of 50 base pairs) than estimates from yeast or Drosophila. We also estimate that typical human male gametes undergo on average 280 non-crossover events where approximately 7 are expected to become visible as gene conversions moving variants from one donor haplotype to an acceptor haplotype.">

        <tr id="DNA replication is regulated by factors that promote or inhibit initiation. In Bacillus subtilis, YabA is a negative regulator of DNA replication initiation while the newly identified kinase CcrZ is a positive regulator. The consequences of under-initiation or over-initiation of DNA replication to genome stability remain unclear. In this work, we measure origin to terminus ratios as a proxy for replication initiation activity. We show that ΔccrZ and several ccrZ alleles under-initiate DNA replication while ablation of yabA or overproduction of CcrZ leads to over-initiation. We find that cells under-initiating DNA replication have few incidents of replication fork stress as determined by low formation of RecA-GFP foci compared with wild type. In contrast, cells over-initiating DNA replication show levels of RecA-GFP foci formation analogous to cells directly challenged with DNA damaging agents. We show that cells under-initiating and over-initiating DNA replication were both sensitive to mitomycin C and that changes in replication initiation frequency cause increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress. With these results, we propose that cells under-initiating DNA replication are sensitive to DNA damage due to a shortage of DNA for repair through homologous recombination. For cells over-initiating DNA replication, we propose that an increase in the number of replication forks leads to replication fork stress which is further exacerbated by chromosomal DNA damage. Together, our study shows that DNA replication initiation frequency must be tightly controlled as changes in initiation influence replication fork fate and the capacity of cells to efficiently repair damage to their genetic material. IMPORTANCE The regulation of DNA replication is fundamental to cell growth and cell cycle control. In eukaryotes under-initiation or over-initiation leads to genome instability. For bacteria, it is unclear how changes in replication initiation frequency impact DNA replication status and genome integrity. We show that tight regulation of DNA replication initiation is critical for maintaining genome integrity. Cells over-initiating or under-initiating DNA replication are sensitive to DNA damage. Further, cells over-initiating DNA replication experience replication fork stress at levels that phenocopy cells encountering DNA damage from the crosslinking agent mitomycin C. Our results establish the critical importance of properly regulating DNA replication initiation frequency because an imbalance in initiation results in replication fork perturbations, deficiencies in DNA repair, and genome instability.">

        <tr id="There remains a large need for a greater understanding of the metastatic process within the prostate cancer field. Our research aims to understand the adaptive – ergo potentially metastatic – responses of cancer to changing microenvironments. Emerging evidence has implicated a role of the Polyaneuploid Cancer Cell (PACC) state in metastasis, positing the PACC state as capable of conferring metastatic competency. Mounting in vitro evidence supports increased metastatic potential of cells in the PACC state. Additionally, our recent retrospective study of prostate cancer patients revealed that PACC presence in the prostate at the time of radical prostatectomy was predictive of future metastatic progression. To test for a causative relationship between PACC state biology and metastasis, we leveraged a novel method designed for flow-cytometric detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in subcutaneous, caudal artery, and intracardiac mouse models of metastasis. This approach provides both quantitative and qualitative information about the number and PACC-status of recovered CTCs and DTCs. Collating data from all models, we found that 74% of recovered CTCs and DTCs were in the PACC state. In vivo colonization assays proved PACC populations can regain proliferative capacity at metastatic sites following dormancy. Additional direct and indirect mechanistic in vitro analyses revealed a PACC-specific partial Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal-Transition phenotype and a pro-metastatic secretory profile, together providing preliminary evidence that PACCs are mechanistically linked to metastasis. Statement of Significance We provide the first evidence that cells in the polyaneuploid cancer cell state contribute to increased metastatic competency in vivo.">

 How does maternal aging impact DNA damage accumulation and DNA repair capacity in mammalian oocytes?



 Age-related changes in DNA repair compartments and chromatin organisation drive DNA damage accumulation in aged oocytes, ultimately contributing to the decline in DNA repair capacity.



 Oocyte loss occurs progressively from birth and accelerates as women approach their mid-30s, posing a significant challenge to female reproductive health. Recent studies have highlighted the role of the DNA repair response in driving ovarian ageing and oocyte loss. Aged oocytes accumulate elevated levels of DNA damage. Unless repaired, persistent DNA damage activates DNA repair checkpoints, causing the elimination of defective oocytes. Although we know DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in oocytes increase with maternal age, surprisingly, little is known about why this damage is not repaired efficiently.



 Oocytes were isolated from ovaries of 8 weeks or 68-86-week-old CD1 mice, which correspond to reproductively young and old females respectively. Over 600 and 1000 oocytes from aged any young females were used to analyse DNA damage levels, DNA repair effciency, DNA repair compartments and for other live assays.



 DNA damage was induced in CD1 oocytes from young and aged mice using neocarzinostatin. Levels of DNA damage and DNA repair proteins were quantified using immunofluoresnce confocal/STED microscopy. High-resolution light sheet microscopy was used to perform live imaging of dynamics of DNA damage foci and chromosome segregation during meiosis.



 Our work demonstrates that aged oocytes have a lower DNA repair capacity and reduced mobility of DNA damage sites compared to young oocytes. We further show that incomplete DNA repair results in defective chromosome integrity and partitioning, thereby compromising oocyte quality. To investigate the causes of the age-related decline in DNA repair, we systematically studied the localization and abundance of several DNA repair proteins in oocytes from young and aged mice. We found that DNA repair proteins localized in spatially distinct DNA repair compartments in oocyte nuclei, that form during the late stages of oocyte growth, accompanied by changes in the activity of DNA repair pathways. Several DNA repair proteins, their corresponding compartments, and their response to DNA damage were altered in aged oocytes. Lastly, we demonstrate that age-related cohesin loss increases DNA damage levels and reduces DNA repair capacity. We hypothesize that cohesin dissociation with maternal ageing may make chromosomes prone to accumulate DNA damage without proper DNA repair. Thus, age-related changes in DNA repair compartments and chromatin organisation drive DNA damage accumulation in aged oocytes, ultimately contributing to the decline in reproductive potential.



 Neocarzinostatin, a radiomimetic drug used to induce DNA DSBs in mouse oocytes in vitro, may not fully represent sources of DNA damage during aging. The CD1 mouse model and ages were selected to recapitulate equivalent advanced maternal age in women. Further investigation is needed to confirm these findings in humans.



 Overall, we propose that altered DNA repair machinery and cohesin loss contribute to persistent DNA damage and reduced DNA repair capacity in aged oocytes, which can cause chromosome defects and fragmentation, and eventually trigger oocyte death, thereby accelerating the loss of female fertility.

        <tr id="Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the most universal repair pathway, which removes a wide range of DNA helix-distorting lesions caused by chemical or physical agents. The final steps of this repair process are gap-filling repair synthesis and subsequent ligation. XPA is the central NER scaffolding protein factor and can be involved in post-incision NER stages. Replication machinery is loaded after the first incision of the damaged strand that is performed by the XPF–ERCC1 nuclease forming a damaged 5′-flap processed by the XPG endonuclease. Flap endonuclease I (FEN1) is a critical component of replication machinery and is absolutely indispensable for the maturation of newly synthesized strands. FEN1 also contributes to the long-patch pathway of base excision repair. Here, we use a set of DNA substrates containing a fluorescently labeled 5′-flap and different size gap to analyze possible repair factor–replication factor interactions. Ternary XPA–FEN1–DNA complexes with each tested DNA are detected. Furthermore, we demonstrate XPA–FEN1 complex formation in the absence of DNA due to protein–protein interaction. Functional assays reveal that XPA moderately inhibits FEN1 catalytic activity. Using fluorescently labeled XPA, formation of ternary RPA–XPA–FEN1 complex, where XPA accommodates FEN1 and RPA contacts simultaneously, can be proposed. We discuss possible functional roles of the XPA–FEN1 interaction in NER related DNA resynthesis and/or other DNA metabolic processes where XPA can be involved in the complex with FEN1.">

These alterations have been used in cancer diagnosis and might be related to the altered functional properties of cancer cells. The nuclear matrix (NM) represents the structural composition of the nucleus and consists of nuclear lamins and pore complexes, an internal ribonucleic protein network, and residual nucleoli. In the nuclear microenvironment, the NM is associated with multi-protein complexes, such as basal transcription factors, signaling proteins, histone-modifying factors, and chromatin remodeling machinery directly or indirectly through scaffolding proteins. Therefore, alterations in the composition of NM could result in altered DNA topology and changes in the interaction of various genes, which could then participate in a cascade of the cancer process. Using an androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, and its androgen-independent derivative, LN96, conventional 2D-proteomic analysis of the NM proteins revealed that purine-rich element binding protein alpha (PURα) was detected in the NM proteins and differentially expressed between the cell lines.

 Investigating a long-standing conceptual question in bacterial physiology, we examine why DnaA, the bacterial master replication initiator protein, exists in both ATP and ADP forms, despite only the ATP form being essential for initiation. We engineered the Δ4
 Escherichia coli
 strain, devoid of all known external elements facilitating the DnaA-ATP/ADP conversion and found that these cells display nearly wild-type behaviors under nonoverlapping replication cycles. However, during rapid growth with overlapping cycles, Δ4 cells exhibit initiation instability. This aligns with our model predictions, suggesting that the intrinsic ATPase activity of DnaA alone is sufficient for robust initiation control in
 E. coli
 and the DnaA-ATP/ADP conversion regulatory elements extend the robustness to multifork replication, indicating an evolutionary adaptation. Moreover, our experiments revealed constant DnaA concentrations during steady-state cell elongation in both wild-type and Δ4 cells. These insights not only advance our understanding of bacterial cell-cycle regulation and DnaA but also highlight a fundamental divergence from eukaryotic cell-cycle controls, emphasizing protein copy-number sensing in bacteria versus programmed protein concentration oscillations in eukaryotes.

        <tr id="Genetic and epigenetic alterations occur in many physiological and pathological processes. The existing knowledge regarding the association of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and their genetic variants on risk and progression of prostate cancer (PCa) is limited. In this study, three genome-wide association study datasets are combined, including 85,707 PCa cases and 166,247 controls, to uncover genetic variants in piRNAs. Functional investigations involved manipulating piRNA expression in cellular and mouse models to study its oncogenetic role in PCa. A specific genetic variant, rs17201241 is identified, associated with increased expression of PROPER (piRNA overexpressed in prostate cancer) in tumors and are located within the gene, conferring an increased risk and malignant progression of PCa. Mechanistically, PROPER coupled with YTHDF2 to recognize N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and facilitated RNA-binding protein interactions between EIF2S3 at 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and YTHDF2/YBX3 at 3'-UTR to promote DUSP1 circularization. This m6A-dependent mRNA-looping pattern enhanced DUSP1 degradation and inhibited DUSP1 translation, ultimately reducing DUSP1 expression and promoting PCa metastasis via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Inhibition of PROPER expression using antagoPROPER effectively suppressed xenograft growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. Thus, targeting piRNA PROPER-mediated genetic and epigenetic fine control is a promising strategy for the concurrent prevention and treatment of PCa.">

        <tr id="Introduction & Objective: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found >1,000 signals associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), most of which occur in noncoding genomic regions. T2D risk increases with age, and aging is accompanied by changes in the epigenomic landscape. Together, these findings suggest that age-related epigenomic change may contribute to T2D risk. Here we profile age-associated epigenomic changes in skeletal muscle, a T2D relevant tissue.
 Methods: We analyzed single nucleus ATAC-seq data from 284 Finnish skeletal muscle biopsies (donor age 20-79 years; mean = 60) to identify age-associated patterns in chromatin accessibility. We used Type 1, 2a, and 2x muscle fiber, endothelial, and fibro/adipogenic progenitor nuclei for analysis. To find age-associated open chromatin regions (OCRs) without assuming linearity, we used Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. We then characterized these OCRs with k-means clustering as well as logistic and linkage disequilibrium score (ldsc) regression enrichment tests.
 Results: Across cell types 6.2 - 15.5% of tested OCRs were age-associated (11,925 - 23,143 OCRs). These OCRs clustered into four patterns of age association: linear positive (Up)/negative (Down) and parabolic positive (Valley)/negative (Arch). These patterns showed distinct enrichment in both gene sets, such as the fast to slow fiber transition gene set in arch patterned Type 1 OCRs (FDR = 2x10^-6), and chromatin states, such as active enhancer chromatin in down patterned Type 2a OCRs (nominal p = 2x10^-29). Ldsc analysis found T2D GWAS signal enrichment in Type 2a up patterned OCRs (nominal p = 0.03). Additionally, 12 age-associated OCRs are chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci that colocalize with T2D GWAS signals.
 Conclusion: These results highlight age-associated epigenomic changes and enrichment for T2D GWAS signals in skeletal muscle cell types, providing a basis for research into development and aging in a T2D relevant tissue.

        <tr id="Introduction The DNA damage repair (DDR) system in human genome is pivotal in maintaining genomic integrity. Pathogenic variation (PV) in DDR genes impairs their function, leading to genome instability and increased susceptibility to diseases, especially cancer. Understanding the evolution origin and arising time of DDR PV is crucial for comprehending disease susceptibility in modern humans. Methods We used big data approach to identify the PVs in DDR genes in modern humans. We mined multiple genomic databases derived from 251,214 modern humans of African and non-Africans. We compared the DDR PVs between African and non-African. We also mined the DDR PVs in the genomic data derived from 5,031 ancient humans. We used the DDR PVs from ancient humans as the intermediate to further the DDR PVs between African and non-African. Results and discussion We identified 1,060 single-base DDR PVs across 77 DDR genes in modern humans of African and non-African. Direct comparison of the DDR PVs between African and non-African showed that 82.1% of the non-African PVs were not present in African. We further identified 397 single-base DDR PVs in 56 DDR genes in the 5,031 ancient humans dated between 45,045 and 100 years before present (BP) lived in Eurasian continent therefore the descendants of the latest out-of-Africa human migrants occurred 50,000–60,000 years ago. By referring to the ancient DDR PVs, we observed that 276 of the 397 (70.3%) ancient DDR PVs were exclusive in non-African, 106 (26.7%) were shared between non-African and African, and only 15 (3.8%) were exclusive in African. We further validated the distribution pattern by testing the PVs in BRCA and TP53, two of the important genes in genome stability maintenance, in African, non-African, and Ancient humans. Our study revealed that DDR PVs in modern humans mostly emerged after the latest out-of-Africa migration. The data provides a foundation to understand the evolutionary basis of disease susceptibility, in particular cancer, in modern humans.">

 How does accurate, unbiased whole genome amplification and tiered, independent, two component analysis impact PGT-A results?



 When compared to previous methods a PGT-A workflow utilizing PTA followed by a CNV and allelic balance-based analysis generated more conclusive results.



 Accurate PGT-A results require unbiased error-free whole genome amplification from the trophectoderm biopsy and smart bioinformatics utilities to fully analyze and consider the large complex datasets. PTA generates fewer errors, greater coverage, and reduced allele drop-out offering the best starting point to interpret the genome of each embryo. Current PGT-A platforms leverage either normalized CNV data OR allelic balance at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to detect alterations in the embryonic genome. A pipeline leveraging improved amplification technology and consolidated CNV and SNP data, particularly for putative mosaic and segmental mosaic calls, could reduce uncertainty and provide more accurate PGT-A results.



 A retrospective analysis of PGT-A results was undertaken with samples originating from multiple clinics and processed in a single laboratory, from January through December, 2023. Approximately 500 samples were processed simultaneously through two independent PGT-A pipelines. The primary objective was to compare the performance of CNV-only PGT-A with a test leveraging both CNV and SNP data. A secondary objective was to observe the resolution of mosaic embryos.



 De-identified samples were amplified with PTA and sequenced with both shotgun (coverage-based CNV) and capture (SNP-based)-approaches. Method specific analysis was applied to the resulting data. An initial bioinformatics approach analyzed CNV data only for variations in copy-number along the genome, proposing stretches of aneuploidy or mosaicism. A second, tiered analysis extended this data and incorporated SNP-based allelic balance to evaluate candidate regions and confirm the presence of aneuploidy and/or quantify mosaic levels.



 Genome-wide read coverage and SNP data confirmed that PTA accurately and completely amplified the genetic material in each sample with broad distribution of informative data and a low allele drop-out rate. High concordance (95%) was observed for euploid and full aneuploid (whole chromosome and segmental) embryos classified with CNV-alone and CNV/SNV combined analysis. SNP data was processed, and B-allele ratios were used to confirm aneuploidies with particular utility in resolving the location of segmental changes. The classification of mosaic samples was altered in the pipeline leveraging both CNV and SNP data. Of 54 mosaic samples tested, 75% remained mosaic after independent consideration of SNP data, ∼15% and 6% of high-level mosaics were resolved to full aneuploid and euploid, respectively, and ∼25% of low-level mosaics reverted to a euploid classification. The deep SNP data produced during targeted sequencing confirmed the altered allele ratio predicted by CNV data and re-confirmed the presence and proportion of aneuploid cells. Mosaic levels were highly correlated in 90% of re-confirmed mosaic samples. This suggests that the classification of these samples as mosaic is precise and accurate and suggests a strong utility for a two component PGT-A pipeline leveraging CNV and SNV data generated from PTA embryos.



 This was a retrospective study with limited sample numbers.



 The study highlights the strong advantages of a hybrid PGT-A pipeline, leveraging PTA and two component analysis of coverage and allelic balance, particularly to resolve mosaic embryos more accurately. Overall, this could reduce uncertainty and deliver more confident PGT-A results for embryo transfer decision making.

        <tr id="Ovarian carcinoma (OC) is a prevalent gynecological malignancy associated with high recurrence rates and mortality, often diagnosed at advanced stages. Despite advances in immunotherapy, immune exhaustion remains a significant challenge in achieving optimal tumor control. However, the exploration of intratumoral heterogeneity of malignant epithelial cells and the ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment is still limited, hindering our comprehensive understanding of the disease.Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we comprehensively investigated the cellular composition across six ovarian cancer patients with omental metastasis. Our focus centered on analysis of the malignant epithelial cells. Employing CytoTRACE and slingshot pseudotime analyses, we identified critical subpopulations and explored associated transcription factors (TFs) influencing ovarian cancer progression. Furthermore, by integrating clinical factors from a large cohort of bulk RNA sequencing data, we have established a novel prognostic model to investigate the impact of the tumor immune microenvironment on ovarian cancer patients. Furthermore, we have investigated the condition of immunological exhaustion.Our study identified a distinct and highly proliferative subgroup of malignant epithelial cells, known as C2 TOP2A+ TCs. This subgroup primarily consisted of patients who hadn’t received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Ovarian cancer patients with elevated TOP2A expression exhibited heightened sensitivity to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Moreover, the transcription factor MYBL2 in this subgroup played a critical role in ovarian cancer development. Additionally, we developed an independent prognostic indicator, the TOP2A TCs Risk Score (TTRS), which revealed a correlation between the High TTRS Group and unfavorable outcomes. Furthermore, immune infiltration and drug sensitivity analyses demonstrated increased responsiveness to Paclitaxel, Cisplatin, and Gemcitabine in the Low TTRS Group.This research deepens our understanding of malignant epithelial cells in ovarian cancer and enhances our knowledge of the ovarian cancer immune microenvironment and immune exhaustion. We have revealed the heightened susceptibility of the C2 TOP2A+ TCs subgroup to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and emphasized the role of MYBL2 within the C2 subgroup in promoting the occurrence and progression of ovarian cancer. These insights provide valuable guidance for the management of ovarian cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent and mortality-causing neoplasia, with various distributions between populations. Strong hereditary predispositions are the causatives of a small percentage of CRC, and most cases have no transparent genetic background. This is a vast arena for exploring cancer low-susceptibility genetic variants. Nonetheless, the research that has been conducted to date has failed to deliver consistent conclusions and often features conflicting messages, causing chaos in this field. Therefore, we decided to organize the existing knowledge on this topic. We screened the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. We drew up markers by gene locus gathered by hallmark: oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, genes involved in DNA damage repair, genes involved in metabolic pathways, genes involved in methylation, genes that modify the colonic microenvironment, and genes involved in the immune response. Low-penetration genetic variants increasing the risk of cancer are often population-specific, hence the urgent need for large-scale testing. Such endeavors can be successful only when financial decision-makers are united with social educators, medical specialists, genetic consultants, and the scientific community. Countries’ policies should prioritize research on this subject regardless of cost because it is the best investment. In this review, we listed potential low-penetrance CRC susceptibility alleles whose role remains to be established.">

        <tr id="Targeting CDC20 can enhance the radiosensitivity of tumor cells, but the function and mechanism of CDC20 on DNA damage repair response remains vague. To examine that issue, tumor cell lines, including KYSE200, KYSE450, and HCT116, were utilized to detect the expression, function, and underlying mechanism of CDC20 in radio-chemoresistance. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were employed to confirm CDC20 expression and location, and radiation could upregulate the expression of CDC20 in the cell nucleus. The homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) reporter gene systems were utilized to explore the impact of CDC20 on DNA damage repair, indicating that CDC20 could promote HR repair and radio/chemo-resistance. In the early stages of DNA damage, CDC20 stabilizes the RPA1 protein through protein-protein interactions, activating the ATR-mediated signaling cascade, thereby aiding in genomic repair. In the later stages, CDC20 assists in the subsequent steps of damage repair by the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of RPA1. CCK-8 and colony formation assay were used to detect the function of CDC20 in cell vitality and proliferation, and targeting CDC20 can exacerbate the increase in DNA damage levels caused by cisplatin or etoposide. A tumor xenograft model was conducted in BALB/c-nu/nu mice to confirm the function of CDC20 in vivo, confirming the in vitro results. In conclusion, this study provides further validation of the potential clinical significance of CDC20 as a strategy to overcome radio-chemoresistance via uncovering a novel role of CDC20 in regulating RPA1 during DNA damage repair.">

        <tr id="Citrus canker, caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc), is a devastating disease worldwide. Previously, we successfully generated canker-resistant Citrus sinensis cv. Hamlin lines in the T0 generation, achieving a mutation efficiency of 97.4%. This was achieved through the transformation of embryogenic protoplasts using the Cas12a/1 crRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) system to edit the canker susceptibility gene, CsLOB1, which led to small indels. Here, we transformed embryogenic protoplasts of Hamlin with Cas12a/3 crRNAs RNP, resulting in 100% efficiency in editing the CsLOB1 gene in the T0 generation. Among the 10 transgene-free genome-edited lines, long deletions were obtained in five lines. Additionally, inversions were observed in three of the five edited lines with long deletions, but not in any edited lines with short indel mutations, suggesting long deletions are required for inversions. Biallelic mutations were observed for each of the three target sites in 4 of the 10 edited lines when 3 crRNAs were used, demonstrating that transformation of embryogenic citrus protoplasts with Cas12a/3 crRNAs RNP can be very efficient for multiplex editing. Our analysis revealed the absence of off-target mutations in the edited lines. These cslob1 mutant lines were canker-resistant and no canker symptoms were observed after inoculation with Xcc and Xcc growth was significantly reduced in the cslob1 mutant lines compared to the wild type plants. Taken together, Cas12a/3 crRNAs RNP transformation of embryogenic protoplasts of citrus provides a promising solution for transgene-free multiplex genome editing with high efficiency and for deletion of long fragments.">

        <tr id="Somatic evolution in ageing tissues underlies many cancers. However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.">

In this study, we demonstrate that the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of 53BP1, HSR-9, associates with chromatin in both proliferating and meiotic germ cells. Notably, HSR-9 is enriched on the X chromosome pair in pachytene oogenic germ cells. HSR-9 is also present at kinetochores during both mitotic and meiotic divisions but does not appear to be essential for monitoring microtubule-kinetochore attachments or tension. Using cytological markers of different steps in recombinational repair, we found that HSR-9 influences the processing of a subset of meiotic double strand breaks into COSA-1-marked crossovers. Additionally, HSR-9 plays a role in meiotic X chromosome segregation under conditions where X chromosomes fail to pair, synapse, and recombine. Together, these results highlight that chromatin-associated HSR-9 has both conserved and unique functions in the regulation of meiotic chromosome behavior.">

        <tr id="Over 50 hereditary degenerative disorders are caused by expansions of short tandem DNA repeats (STRs). (GAA)n repeat expansions are responsible for Friedreich’s ataxia as well as late-onset cerebellar ataxias (LOCAs). Thus, the mechanisms of (GAA)n repeat expansions attract broad scientific attention. To investigate the role of DNA nicks in this process, we utilized a CRISPR-Cas9 nickase system to introduce targeted nicks adjacent to the (GAA)n repeat tract. We found that DNA nicks 5’ of the (GAA)100 run led to a dramatic increase in both the rate and scale of its expansion in dividing cells. Strikingly, they also promoted large-scale expansions of carrier- and large normal-size (GAA)n repeats, recreating, for the first time in a model system, the expansion events that occur in human pedigrees. DNA nicks 3’ of the (GAA)100 repeat led to a smaller but significant increase in the expansion rate as well. Our genetic analysis implies that in dividing cells, conversion of nicks into double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication followed by DSB or fork repair leads to repeat expansions. Finally, we showed that 5’ strand nicks increase expansion frequency in non-dividing yeast cells, albeit to a lesser extent that in dividing cells.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer with diverse genetic variations and DNA methylation alterations. By studying the interaction of gene mutations, expression, and DNA methylation, we aimed to gain valuable insights into the processes that lead to block differentiation in AML. We analyzed TCGA-LAML data (173 samples) with RNA sequencing and DNA methylation arrays, comparing FLT3 mutant (48) and wild-type (125) cases. We conducted differential gene expression analysis using cBioPortal, identified DNA methylation differences with ChAMP tool, and correlated them with gene expression changes. Gene set enrichment analysis (g:Profiler) revealed significant biological processes and pathways. ShinyGo and GeneCards were used to find potential transcription factors and their binding sites among significant genes. We found significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) negatively correlated with their most significant methylation probes (Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.49, P-value <0.001) between FLT3 mutant and wild-type groups. Moreover, our exploration of 450 k CpG sites uncovered a global hypo-methylated status in 168 DEGs. Notably, these methylation changes were enriched in the promoter regions of Homebox superfamily gene, which are crucial in transcriptional-regulating pathways in blood cancer. Furthermore, in FLT3 mutant AML patient samples, we observed overexpress of WT1, a transcription factor known to bind homeobox gene family. This finding suggests a potential mechanism by which WT1 recruits TET2 to demethylate specific genomic regions. Integrating gene expression and DNA methylation analyses shed light on the impact of FLT3 mutations on cancer cell development and differentiation, supporting a two-hit model in AML. This research advances understanding of AML and fosters targeted therapeutic strategy development.">

        <tr id="The emergence of cancers involves numerous coding and non-coding genes. Understanding the contribution of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) to the cancer neighborhood is crucial for interpreting the interaction between molecular markers of cancer. However, there is a lack of systematic studies on the involvement of ncRNAs in the cancer neighborhood. In this paper, we construct an interaction network which encompasses multiple genes. We focus on the fundamental topological indicator, namely connectivity, and evaluate its performance when applied to cancer-affected genes using statistical indices. Our findings reveal that ncRNAs significantly enhance the connectivity of affected genes and mediate the inclusion of more genes in the cancer module. To further explore the role of ncRNAs in the network, we propose a connectivity-based method which leverages the bridging function of ncRNAs across cancer-affected genes and reveals the non-coding RNAs extended omnigenic module (NeOModule). Topologically, this module promotes the formation of cancer patterns involving ncRNAs. Biologically, it is enriched with cancer pathways and treatment targets, providing valuable insights into disease relationships.">

Understanding the impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) on solid tumor risk and mortality can shed light on novel cancer pathways.


METHODS
The authors analyzed whole genome sequencing data from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine Women's Health Initiative study (n = 10,866). They investigated the presence of CHIP and mCA and their association with the development and mortality of breast, lung, and colorectal cancers.


RESULTS
CHIP was associated with higher risk of breast (hazard ratio [HR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.64; p = .02) but not colorectal (p = .77) or lung cancer (p = .32). CHIP carriers who developed colorectal cancer also had a greater risk for advanced-stage (p = .01), but this was not seen in breast or lung cancer. CHIP was associated with increased colorectal cancer mortality both with (HR, 3.99; 95% CI, 2.41-6.62; p < .001) and without adjustment (HR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.32-4.72; p = .004) for advanced-stage and a borderline higher breast cancer mortality (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 0.98-2.41; p = .06). Conversely, mCA (cell fraction [CF] >3%) did not correlate with cancer risk. With higher CFs (mCA >5%), autosomal mCA was associated with increased breast cancer risk (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.06-1.83; p = .01). There was no association of mCA (>3%) with breast, colorectal, or lung mortality except higher colon cancer mortality (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.11-4.3; p = .02) with mCA >5%.


CONCLUSIONS
CHIP and mCA (CF >5%) were associated with higher breast cancer risk and colorectal cancer mortality individually. These data could inform on novel pathways that impact cancer risk and lead to better risk stratification.">

        <tr id="Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a metainflammatory disease characterized by impairments in mitochondrial function and ultrastructure that contribute to the overall disruption of β-cell function. Mitochondria rely on both the nuclear genome as well as their own 16.6 kilobase-pair circular genome to generate the machinery required for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Recently, our group identified a reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number in islets from donors with T2D, indicating a disruption in mitochondrial genome stability. While mtDNA genome instability is implicated in several diseases, its impact on β-cell dysfunction in diabetes has yet to be explored. Here, we generated a mouse model prone to increased β-cell mtDNA deletions by selective expression of a dominant negative Twinkle (TwnkK320E) helicase mutant, which is essential for mtDNA maintenance. Beginning at 5 weeks, β-TwnkK320E mice exhibited impaired glucose tolerance, which progressively worsened with age. Circulating insulin concentrations following glucose stimulation were also reduced in β-TwnkK320E mice by 5 weeks of age, yet there was no difference in β-cell mass, suggestive of a β cell functional defect. Further, we observed a complete loss of MafA, a key regulator of β-cell maturity, from a subset of β cells in β-TwnkK320E mice. While mitochondrial mass was unchanged between groups, β‑TwnkK320E islets have altered expression of subunits of all OXPHOS complexes, as well as reduced glucose-stimulated oxygen consumption, indicative of impaired mitochondrial function. Together, these data suggest that the accumulation of mtDNA deletions diminishes β-cell function and support the importance of mitochondrial genome integrity to β-cell health.

        <tr id="YAP is a central player in cancer development with functions extending beyond its recognized role in cell growth regulation. Recent work has identified a link between YAP/TAZ and the DNA damage response. Here, we investigated the mechanistic underpinnings of the crosstalk between DNA damage repair and YAP activity. Ku70, a key component of the non-homologous end joining pathway to repair DNA damage, engaged in a dynamic competition with TEAD4 for binding to YAP, limiting the transcriptional activity of YAP. Depletion of Ku70 enhanced interaction between YAP and TEAD4 and boosted YAP transcriptional capacity. Consequently, Ku70 loss enhanced tumorigenesis in colon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vivo. YAP impeded DNA damage repair and elevated genome instability by inducing PARP1 degradation through the SMURF2-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Analysis of HCC patient samples substantiated the link between Ku70 expression, YAP activity, PARP1 levels, and genome instability. In conclusion, this research provides insight into the mechanistic interactions between YAP and key regulators of DNA damage repair, highlighting the role of a Ku70-YAP-PARP1 axis in preserving genome stability.">

        <tr id="One of the main causes of cancer-related mortality for women worldwide is breast cancer (BC). The XRCC2 gene, essential for DNA repair, has been implicated in cancer susceptibility. This study aims to evaluate the association between XRCC2 and BC risk. The study was conducted at Zheen International Hospital in Erbil, Iraq, between 2021 and 2024 with a total of 88 samples, including 44 paired normal and cancer tissue samples. Mutation analysis was performed using Next-Generation Sequencing, coupled with in silico tools for variant impact prediction. Expression levels were assessed through RT-PCR, and methylation status was determined using methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion PCR. The study identified seven inherited germline variants in the XRCC2 gene, with five of these mutations being Uncertain Significance, one being Likely Pathogenic, and one being Likely benign. RNA purity was found high with mean A260/280 ratios of 1.986 ± 0.097 in normal (N) and 1.963 ± 0.092 in tumor (T) samples. Tumor samples exhibited a higher RNA concentration (78.56 ± 40.87 ng/µL) than normal samples (71.44 ± 40.79 ng/µL). XRCC2 gene expression was significantly upregulated in tumor tissue, with marked increases in patients aged 40-55 and >56 years and in higher cancer grades (II and III) and invasive ductal carcinoma (p-values ranging from <0.0001 to 0.0392). DNA methylation rates in tumor tissues were low (7%), suggesting limited regulation by methylation. The study suggests that XRCC2 can be classified as an oncogene and that its structural investigation by targeted NGS and expression evaluation can be used as a potential biomarker in BC.">

In human cells, replication of single-stranded shuttle vectors containing Fapy•dG is more mutagenic than 8-OxodGuo. Here, we present the first data regarding promoter dependent RNA polymerase II bypass of Fapy•dG. 8-OxodGuo bypass was examined side-by-side. Experiments were carried out using double-stranded shuttle vectors in HeLa cell nuclear lysates and in HEK 293T cells. The lesions do not significantly block transcriptional bypass efficiency. Less than 2% adenosine incorporation occurred in cells when the lesions were base paired with dC. Inhibiting base excision repair in HEK 293T cells significantly increased adenosine incorporation, particularly from Fapy•dG:dC bypass which yielded ∼25% adenosine incorporation. No effect was detected upon transcriptional bypass of either lesion in nucleotide excision repair deficient cells. Transcriptional mutagenesis was significantly higher when shuttle vectors containing dA opposite one of the lesions were employed. For Fapy•dG:dA bypass, adenosine incorporation was greater than 85%; whereas 8-OxodGuo:dA yielded >20% point mutations. The combination of more frequent replication mistakes and greater error-prone Pol II bypass suggest that Fapy•dG is more mutagenic than 8-OxodGuo.">

Detection of minor DNA allele alterations is becoming increasingly important for early detection and monitoring of cancer. We describe a new method that uses ultraviolet light to eliminate wild-type DNA alleles and enables improved detection of minor genetic or epigenetic changes.


METHODS
Pyrimidine-dependent UV-based minor-allele enrichment (PD-UVME) employed oligonucleotide probes that incorporated a UVA-sensitive 3-cyanovinylcarbazole (CNVK), placed directly opposite interrogated pyrimidines, such as thymine (T) or cytosine (C) in wild-type (WT) DNA. Upon UVA-illumination, CNVK cross-linked with T/C, preventing subsequent amplification. Mutations that removed the T/C escaped cross-linking and were amplified and detected. Similarly, CNVK discriminated between methylated and unmethylated cytosine in CpG dinucleotides, enabling direct enrichment of unmethylated DNA targets. PD-UVME was combined with digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) to detect serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf (BRAF) V600E mutations in model systems, thyroid patient cancer tissue samples, and circulating DNA of tumor origin (ctDNA) from melanoma patients.


RESULTS
One thyroid cancer sample out of 9, and 6 circulating-DNA samples out of 7 were found to be BRAF V600E-positive via PD-UVME while classified as negative by conventional ddPCR. Positive samples via conventional ddPCR were also found positive via PD-UVME. All 10 circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples obtained from normal volunteers were negative via both approaches. Furthermore, preferential enrichment of unmethylated alleles in MAGEA1 promoters using PD-UVME was demonstrated.


CONCLUSIONS
PD-UVME mutation/methylation enrichment performed prior to ddPCR magnifies low-level mutations or epigenetic changes and increases sensitivity and confidence in the results. It can assist with clinical decisions that hinge on the presence of trace alterations like BRAF V600E.">
