        <tr id="Drug resistance is a major challenge in the treatment of advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Understanding the mechanisms of drug resistance can aid in identifying novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve treatment efficacy. This study established 5-fluorouracil- (5-FU) and gemcitabine-resistant CCA cell lines, KKU-213FR and KKU-213GR, and utilized comparative proteomics to identify differentially expressed proteins in drug-resistant cells compared to parental cells. Additionally, bioinformatics analyses were conducted to explore the biological and clinical significance of key proteins. The drug-resistant phenotypes of KKU-213FR and KKU-213GR cell lines were confirmed. In addition, these cells demonstrated increased migration and invasion abilities. Proteomics analysis identified 81 differentially expressed proteins in drug-resistant cells, primarily related to binding functions, biological regulation, and metabolic processes. Protein–protein interaction analysis revealed a highly interconnected network involving MET, LAMB1, ITGA3, NOTCH2, CDH2, and NDRG1. siRNA-mediated knockdown of these genes in drug-resistant cell lines attenuated cell migration and cell invasion abilities and increased sensitivity to 5-FU and gemcitabine. The mRNA expression of these genes is upregulated in CCA patient samples and is associated with poor prognosis in gastrointestinal cancers. Furthermore, the functions of these proteins are closely related to the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. These findings elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance and tumor progression in CCA, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Therapeutic resistance is the leading cause of treatment failure and death from cancer. While resistance can be driven by genetic mutations, mounting evidence also points to an epigenetic basis of resistance. Much of this epigenetic, or non-genetic, resistance has been attributed to drug-resistant transcriptional cell states that are either induced by drug treatment or pre-exist in a fraction of cells selected by treatment. However, the extent to which long-term resistance is manifested in the early inherent cellular response to drugs is poorly understood, and which aspects, if any, of this early response to drug-induced transcriptional response are evolutionarily conserved properties of cells. To address these questions, we integrate datasets of long-term drug resistance and early drug response data across multiple cell lines with drug response and resistance data from bacteria and yeast. Our findings suggest that cancer cell states in both the drug-naive populations as well as in populations shortly after treatment share transcriptional properties with fully established resistant cell populations, and CRISPR-cas9 knockout of transcription factors predicted to regulate the resistant transcriptional programs result in inceased drug sensitivity. Furthermore, the resistance states manifested as early drug response are evolutionarily conserved. Finally, we show that early resistant states discriminate responders from non-responders across multiple human cancer trials.">

        <tr id="Leukemia is characterized by oncogenic lesions that result in a block of differentiation while phenotypic plasticity is retained. A better understanding of how these two phenomena arise during leukemogenesis in humans could help inform diagnosis and treatment strategies. Here, we leveraged the well-defined differentiation states during T-cell development to pinpoint the initiation of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), an aggressive form of childhood leukemia, and study the emergence of phenotypic plasticity. Single-cell whole genome sequencing of leukemic blasts was combined with multiparameter flow cytometry to couple cell identity and clonal lineages. Irrespective of genetic events, leukemia-initiating cells altered their phenotypes by differentiation and de-differentiation. Construction of phylogenies of individual leukemias using somatic mutations revealed that phenotypic diversity is reflected by the clonal structure of the cancer. The analysis also indicated that the acquired phenotypes are heritable and stable. Together, these results demonstrate a transient period of plasticity during leukemia initiation where phenotypic switches appear unidirectional.">

        <tr id="Cancer resistance refers to the ability of cancer cells to evade the effects of treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation, making it challenging to eliminate tumors. Cancer cells develop resistance through genetic modifications, alterations in cellular pathways, or microenvironmental adaptations that allow cancer cells to persist, proliferate, and even thrive despite the application of therapies designed to eradicate them. Despite efforts to create more potent target-based drugs, the flexibility of acquired resistance necessitates advanced options. Combination therapy and precision immunotherapy has revolutionized treatment but is limited by patient specificity and requires further development. New approaches like small molecules, peptides, and nanotherapeutics aim to overcome resistance by enhancing site-specific delivery and increasing drug concentration inside cancer cells. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer drug resistance, including genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations, efflux pump activity, and the influence of the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, the roles of microRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and cellular processes such as autophagy and hypoxia in mediating resistance are examined. This review seeks to improve patient care and help to the development of more effective cancer medicines by explaining these complicated systems and investigating novel therapeutic alternatives.">

        <tr id="Purpose: Complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCRs) are rare structural variants involving three or more chromosomal break- points. Most de novo reported CCRs pose challenges for diagnosis and management. They often require karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) for clinical diagnosis because of the limitations of each method. Here we report an inherited exceptionally complex CCR involving 4 chromosomes and 11 breakpoints in a family with multisystem anomalies. Methods: We evaluated the CCRs using karyotyping, FISH, CMA, and two emerging genomic technologies: high-throughput chromosome conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C; aka genomic proximity mapping, GPM) and optical genome mapping (OGM). We also performed functional studies using transcriptome and methylome analyses. Results: The proband, who had intellectual disability and immune deficiency, shared CCRs with her unaffected mother involving chromosomes 1, 7, and 11 by karyotyping. However, CMA revealed a duplication and three deletions in the proband in contrast to her mother's balanced genome. Hi-C (GPM) and OGM detected the CCRs and copy number alterations but also uncovered additional breakpoints at high resolution, including an insertion in 4p and two cryptic rearrangements at 7p. Transcriptome and methylome analyses identified likely biological pathways associated with the proband's phenotypes. Conclusion: Combining cytogenetic and genomic methods provided comprehensive characterization and defined the breakpoints at high resolution in both proband and mother. This underscores the value of novel cytogenetic and genomic techniques in deciphering complex genome rearrangements and the significance of integrative genomic analysis and functional characterization in understanding clinical phenotypes.">

        <tr id="Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a major axis of phenotypic plasticity not only in diseased conditions such as cancer metastasis and fibrosis but also during normal development and wound healing. Yet-another important axis of plasticity with metastatic implications includes the cancer stem cell (CSCs) and non-CSC transitions. However, in both processes, epithelial (E) and mesenchymal (M) phenotypes are not merely binary states. Cancer cells acquire a spectrum of phenotypes with traits, properties, and markers of both E and M phenotypes, giving rise to intermediary hybrid (E/M) phenotypes. E/M cells play an important role in tumor initiation, metastasis, and disease progression in multiple cancers. Furthermore, the hybrid phenotypes also play a major role in causing therapeutic resistance in cancer. Here, we discuss how a systems biology perspective on the problem, which is implicit in the ‘Team Medicine’ approach outlined in the theme of this Special Issue of The Journal of Clinical Medicine and includes an interdisciplinary team of experts, is more likely to shed new light on EMT in cancer and help us to identify novel therapeutics and strategies to target phenotypic plasticity in cancer.">

        <tr id="Outcomes for women with breast cancer have improved dramatically in recent decades. However, many patients present with intrinsic drug resistance and others are initially sensitive to anti-cancer drugs but acquire resistance during the course of their treatment, leading to recurrence and/or metastasis. Drug therapy-induced senescence (TIS) is a form of drug resistance characterised by the induction of cell cycle arrest and the emergence of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that can develop in response to chemo- and targeted- therapies. A wide range of anticancer interventions can lead to cell cycle arrest and SASP induction, by inducing genotoxic stress, hyperactivation of signalling pathways or oxidative stress. TIS can be anti-tumorigenic in the short-term, but pro-tumorigenic in the long-term by creating a pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Moreover, the SASP can promote angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in neighbouring cells. In this review, we will describe the characteristics of TIS in breast cancer and detail the changes in phenotype that accompany its induction. We also discuss strategies for targeting senescent cancer cells in order to prevent or delay tumour recurrence.">

        <tr id="Cancer is the second leading cause of global mortality and claims approximately 10 million lives annually. Despite advances in treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, resistance to these methods has emerged. Multidrug resistance (MDR), where cancer cells resist diverse treatments, undermines therapy effectiveness, escalating mortality rates. MDR mechanisms include, among others, drug inactivation, reduced drug uptake, enhanced DNA repair, and activation of survival pathways such as autophagy. Moreover, MDR mechanisms can confer resistance to other therapies like radiotherapy. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for improving treatment efficacy and identifying new therapeutic targets. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gathered attention for their role in cancer progression, including MDR development through protein transfer and genetic reprogramming. Autophagy, a process balancing cellular resources, also influences MDR. The intersection of EVs and autophagy further complicates the understanding of MDR. Both extracellular (exosomes, microvesicles) and intracellular (autophagic) vesicles contribute to therapy resistance by regulating the tumor microenvironment, facilitating cell communication, and modulating drug processing. While much is known about these pathways, there is still a need to explore their potential for predicting treatment responses and understanding tumor heterogeneity.">

        <tr id="All routine clinical treatments for colorectal cancer include 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which cannot counteract recurrence and metastases formation. As the pyrimidine analog 5-FU can impact multiple pathways including both DNA and RNA metabolism, studying its mode of actions could lead to improved therapies. Using a dedicated reporter system for lineage-tracing and deep translatome profiling we demonstrate that 5-FU causes some colorectal cancer cells to tolerate the drug, due to a durable translational reprogramming that sustains cell plasticity. This period of drug tolerance coincides with specific translational activation of genes coding for proteins with major pro-tumoral functions. We unravel a major unexpected translational overexpression of the pro-inflammatory and pro-tumoral IL-8 cytokine, alongside other anti-apoptotic, senescence-associated secretory phenotype and cancer-related senescence phenotype genes. Given the adverse prognostic implications of elevated IL-8 levels across various cancers, our findings suggest IL-8 targeting could counteract 5-FU resistance.">

        <tr id="Copy number alterations (CNAs), resulting from the gain or loss of genetic material from as little as 50 base pairs or as big as entire chromosome(s), have been associated with many congenital diseases, de novo syndromes and cancer. It is established that CNAs disturb the dosage of genomic regions including enhancers/promoters, long non-coding RNA and gene(s) among others, ultimately leading to an altered balance of key cellular functions. In cancer, CNAs have been associated with almost all steps of the disease: predisposition, initiation, development, maintenance, response to treatment, resistance, and relapse. Therefore, understanding how specific CNAs contribute to tumourigenesis may provide prognostic insight and ultimately lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes. In this review, we provide a snapshot of what is currently known about CNAs and cancer, incorporating topics regarding their detection, clinical impact, origin, and nature, and discuss the integration of innovative genetic engineering strategies, to highlight the potential for targeting CNAs using novel, dosage-sensitive and less toxic therapies for CNA-driven cancer.">

We demonstrate that melanoma cells can form and maintain cellular memories during the acquisition of therapy resistance that exhibit characteristics of cellular learning and are dependent on the transcription factor AP-1. We show that cells exposed to a low dose of therapy adapt to become resistant to a high dose, demonstrating that resistance was not purely selective. The application of therapy itself results in the encoding of transient gene expression into cellular memory and that this encoding occurs for both transiently induced and probabilistically arising expression. Chromatin accessibility showed concomitant persistence. A two-color AP-1 reporter system showed that these memories are encoded in cis, constituting an example of activating cis epigenetics. Our findings establish the formation and maintenance of cellular memories as a critical aspect of gene regulation during the development of therapy resistance.">

        <tr id="Genomic instability is one of the main drivers of tumorigenesis and the development of hematological malignancies. Cancer cells can remedy chemotherapeutic-induced DNA damage by upregulating DNA-repair genes and ultimately inducing therapy resistance. Nevertheless, the association between the DNA-repair genes, drug resistance, and disease relapse has not been well characterized in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study aimed to explore the role of the DNA-repair machinery and the molecular mechanisms by which it is regulated in early- and late-relapsing pediatric ALL patients. We performed secondary data analysis on the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET)—ALL expansion phase II trial of 198 relapsed pediatric precursor B-cell ALL. Comprehensive genetic and epigenetic investigations of 147 DNA-repair genes were conducted in the study. Gene expression was assessed using Microarray and RNA-sequencing platforms. Genomic alternations, methylation status, and miRNA transcriptome were investigated for the candidate DNA-repair genes. We identified three DNA-repair genes, ALKBH3, NHEJ1, and PARP1, that were upregulated in early relapsers compared to late relapsers (p < 0.05). Such upregulation at diagnosis was significantly associated with disease-free survival and overall survival in precursor-B-ALL (p < 0.05). Moreover, PARP1 upregulation accompanied a significant downregulation of its targeting miRNA, miR-1301-3p (p = 0.0152), which was strongly linked with poorer disease-free and overall survivals. Upregulation of DNA-repair genes, PARP1 in particular, increases the likelihood of early relapse of precursor-B-ALL in children. The observation that PARP1 was upregulated in early relapsers relative to late relapsers might serve as a valid rationale for proposing alternative treatment approaches, such as using PARP inhibitors with chemotherapy.">

        <tr id="A fundamental obstacle to tackling the antimicrobial resistance crsisis is identifying mutations that lead to resistance in a given genomic background and environment. We present a high-throughput technique – Quantitative Mutational Scan Sequencing (QMS-Seq) – that enables quantitative comparison of which genes are under antibiotic selection and captures how genetic background influences resistance evolution. We compared four E. coli strains exposed to ciprofloxacin, cycloserine, or nitrofurantoin and identified 975 resistance mutations, many in genes and regulatory regions not previously associated with resistance. QMS-Seq revealed that multi-drug and antibiotic-specific resistance are acquired through categorically different types of mutations, and that minor genotypic differences significantly influence evolutionary routes to resistance. By quantifying mutation frequency with single base pair resolution, QMS-Seq informs about the underlying mechanisms of resistance and identifies mutational hotspots within genes. Our method provides a way to rapidly screen for resistance mutations while assessing the impact of multiple confounding factors.">

        <tr id="Epigenetic evolution is a common mechanism used by cancer cells to evade the therapeutic effects of drug treatment. In ovarian cancers, epigenetically-driven resistance may be responsible for a large number of late-stage patient deaths. Here, we describe the first investigation into the role of G-quadruplex (G4) DNA secondary structures in mediating epigenetic regulation in drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Through genome-wide mapping of G4s in paired drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cell lines, we find that increased G4 formation is associated with significant increase in gene expression, with high enrichment in signalling pathways previously established to promote drug-resistant states. However, in contrast to previous studies, the expression-enhancing effects of G4s were not found at gene promoters, but intergenic and intronic regions, indicating that G4s promote long-range transcriptional regulation in drug-resistant cells. Furthermore, we discovered that clusters of G4s (super-G4s) are associated with particularly high levels of transcriptional enhancement that surpass the effects of super-enhancers, which act as well established regulatory sites in many cancers. Finally, we demonstrate that targeting G4s with small molecules results in significant down-regulation of pathways associated with drug-resistance, which results in resensitisation of resistant cells to chemotherapy agents. These findings indicate that G4 structures are critical for the epigenetic regulatory networks of drug-resistant cells and may represent a promising target to treat drug-tolerant ovarian cancer.">

        <tr id="Abstract Multiple myeloma (MM) is a genetically heterogeneous disease and the management of relapses is one of the biggest clinical challenges. TP53 alterations are established high‐risk markers and are included in the current disease staging criteria. KRAS is the most frequently mutated gene affecting around 20% of MM patients. Applying Clonal Competition Assays (CCA) by co‐culturing color‐labeled genetically modified cell models, we recently showed that mono‐ and biallelic alterations in TP53 transmit a fitness advantage to the cells. Here, we report a similar dynamic for two mutations in KRAS (G12A and A146T), providing a biological rationale for the high frequency of KRAS and TP53 alterations at MM relapse. Resistance mutations, on the other hand, did not endow MM cells with a general fitness advantage but rather presented a disadvantage compared to the wild‐type. CUL4B KO and IKZF1 A152T transmit resistance against immunomodulatory agents, PSMB5 A20T to proteasome inhibition. However, MM cells harboring such lesions only outcompete the culture in the presence of the respective drug. To better prevent the selection of clones with the potential of inducing relapse, these results argue in favor of treatment‐free breaks or a switch of the drug class given as maintenance therapy. In summary, the fitness benefit of TP53 and KRAS mutations was not treatment‐related, unlike patient‐derived drug resistance alterations that may only induce an advantage under treatment. CCAs are suitable models for the study of clonal evolution and competitive (dis)advantages conveyed by a specific genetic lesion of interest, and their dependence on external factors such as the treatment.">

These challenges are largely due to its obscure normal epithelial origins, evolutionary stability, and transitions on the cancer subtypes. This study aims to elucidate the cellular emergence and maintenance of heterogeneous breast cancer via quantitative bio-process modeling, with potential benefit to therapeutic strategies for the disease. An endogenous molecular–cellular hypothesis posits that both pathological and physiological states are phenotypes evolved from and shaped by interactions among a number of conserved modules and cellular factors within a biological network. We hereby developed a model of core endogenous network for breast cancer in accordance with the theory, quantifying its intrinsic dynamic properties with dynamic modeling. The model spontaneously generates cell states that align with molecular classifications at both the molecular and modular level, replicating four widely recognized molecular subtypes of the cancer and validating against data extracted from the TCGA database. Further analysis shows that topologically, a singular progression gateway from normal breast cells to cancerous states is identified as the Luminal A-type breast cancer. Activated positive feedback loops are found to stabilize cellular states, while negative feedback loops facilitate state transitions. Overall, more routes are revealed on the cellular transition between stable states, and a traceable count explains the origin of breast cancer heterogeneity. Ultimately, the research intended to strength the search for therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Epitranscriptomics is a field that delves into post-transcriptional changes. Among these modifications, the conversion of adenosine to inosine, traduced as guanosine (A>I(G)), is one of the known RNA-editing mechanisms, catalyzed by ADARs. This type of RNA editing is the most common type of editing in mammals and contributes to biological diversity. Disruption in the A>I(G) RNA-editing balance has been linked to diseases, including several types of cancer. Drug resistance in patients with cancer represents a significant public health concern, contributing to increased mortality rates resulting from therapy non-responsiveness and disease progression, representing the greatest challenge for researchers in this field. The A>I(G) RNA editing is involved in several mechanisms over the immunotherapy and genotoxic drug response and drug resistance. This review investigates the relationship between ADAR1 and specific A>I(G) RNA-edited sites, focusing particularly on breast cancer, and the impact of these sites on DNA damage repair and the immune response over anti-cancer therapy. We address the underlying mechanisms, bioinformatics, and in vitro strategies for the identification and validation of A>I(G) RNA-edited sites. We gathered databases related to A>I(G) RNA editing and cancer and discussed the potential clinical and research implications of understanding A>I(G) RNA-editing patterns. Understanding the intricate role of ADAR1-mediated A>I(G) RNA editing in breast cancer holds significant promise for the development of personalized treatment approaches tailored to individual patients’ A>I(G) RNA-editing profiles.">

        <tr id="While balanced reciprocal translocations are relatively common, they often remain clinically silent unless they lead to the disruption of functional genes. In this study, we present the case of a boy exhibiting developmental delay and mild intellectual disability. Initial karyotyping revealed a translocation t(5;6)(q13;q23) between chromosomes 5 and 6 with limited resolution. Optical genome mapping (OGM) enabled a more precise depiction of the breakpoint regions involved in the reciprocal translocation. While the breakpoint region on chromosome 6 did not encompass any known gene, OGM revealed the disruption of the RASGRF2 (Ras protein-specific guanine nucleotide releasing factor 2) gene on chromosome 5, implicating RASGRF2 as a potential candidate gene contributing to the observed developmental delay in the patient. Variations in RASGRF2 have so far not been reported in developmental delay, but research on the RASGRF2 gene underscores its significance in various aspects of neurodevelopment, including synaptic plasticity, signaling pathways, and behavioral responses. This study highlights the utility of OGM in identifying breakpoint regions, providing possible insights into the understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders. It also helps affected individuals in gaining more knowledge about potential causes of their conditions.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
In multiple myeloma (MM), therapy-induced clonal evolution is associated with treatment resistance and is one of the most important hindrances toward a cure for MM. To further understand the molecular mechanisms controlling the clonal evolution of MM, we applied single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to paired diagnostic and post-treatment bone marrow (BM) samples.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
scRNA-seq was performed on 38 BM samples from patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) (n = 1), MM patients at diagnosis (n = 19), MM post-treatment (n = 17), and one healthy donor. The single-cell transcriptome data of malignant plasma cells and the surrounding immune microenvironment were analyzed.


RESULTS
Profiling by scRNA-seq data revealed three primary trajectories of transcriptional evolution after treatment: clonal elimination in patients with undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD-), as well as clonal stabilization and clonal selection in detectable MRD (MRD+) patients. We noted a metabolic shift towards fatty acid oxidation in cycling-resistant plasma cells (PCs), while selective PCs favored the NF-κB pathway. Intriguingly, when comparing the genetic and transcriptional dynamics, we found a significant correlation between genetic and non-genetic factors in driving the clonal evolution. Furthermore, we identified variations in cellular interactions between malignant plasma cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Selective PCs showed the most robust cellular interactions with the TME.


CONCLUSIONS
These data suggest that MM cells could rapidly adapt to induction treatment through transcriptional adaptation, metabolic adaptation, and specialized immune evasion. Targeting therapy-induced resistance mechanisms may help to avert refractory disease in multiple myeloma.">

        <tr id="Introduction A hallmark of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is its recalcitrance to therapy. While most SCLCs respond to frontline therapy, resistance inevitably develops. Identifying phenotypes potentiating chemoresistance and immune evasion is a crucial unmet need. Previous reports have linked upregulation of the DNA damage response (DDR) machinery to chemoresistance and immune evasion across cancers. However, it is unknown if SCLCs exhibit distinct DDR phenotypes. Methods To study SCLC DDR phenotypes, we developed a new DDR gene analysis method and applied it to SCLC clinical samples, in vitro, and in vivo model systems. We then investigated how DDR regulation is associated with SCLC biology, chemotherapy response, and tumor evolution following therapy. Results Using multi-omic profiling, we demonstrate that SCLC tumors cluster into three DDR phenotypes with unique molecular features. Hallmarks of these DDR clusters include differential expression of DNA repair genes, increased replication stress, and heightened G2/M cell cycle arrest. SCLCs with elevated DDR phenotypes exhibit increased neuroendocrine features and decreased “inflamed” biomarkers, both within and across SCLC subtypes. Treatment naive DDR status identified SCLC patients with different responses to frontline chemotherapy. Tumors with initial DDR Intermediate and DDR High phenotypes demonstrated greater tendency for subtype switching and emergence of heterogeneous phenotypes following treatment. Conclusions We establish that SCLC can be classified into one of three distinct, clinically relevant DDR clusters. Our data demonstrates that DDR status plays a key role in shaping SCLC phenotypes, chemotherapy response, and patterns of tumor evolution. Future work targeting DDR specific phenotypes will be instrumental in improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of lymphoma. Despite initial treatment, up to 40% of patients do not achieve a cure and need second-line therapy. For those experiencing late relapse or lacking access to CAR-T cell therapy, platinum-based chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation remains the standard of care. In this study, we used genomewide CRISPR/Cas9 screens and single-gene knockout experiments to identify the genes associated with responses to platinum-based drugs. We provide a comprehensive list of genes involved in the response to cisplatin in DLBCL. Our functional experiments highlight the critical roles of the DNA damage response genes XPA and ERCC6, in addition to BTK, in the response to platinum-based drugs. Additionally, we show that inhibition of BTK at lower concentrations sensitizes DLBCL cells to platinum-based drugs. Abstract The recurrence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been observed in 40% of cases. The standard of care for refractory/relapsed DLBCL (RR-DLBCL) is platinum-based treatment prior to autologous stem cell transplantation; however, the prognosis for RR-DLBCL patients remains poor. Thus, to identify genes affecting the cisplatin response in DLBCL, cisplatin-based whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens were performed in this study. We discovered DNA damage response (DDR) pathways as enriched among identified sensitizing CRISPR-mediated gene knockouts. In line, the knockout of the nucleotide excision repair genes XPA and ERCC6 sensitized DLBCL cells to platinum drugs irrespective of proliferation rate, thus documenting DDR as essential for cisplatin sensitivity in DLBCL. Functional analysis revealed that the loss of XPA and ERCC6 increased DNA damage levels and altered cell cycle distribution. Interestingly, we also identified BTK, which is involved in B-cell receptor signaling, to affect cisplatin response. The knockout of BTK increased cisplatin sensitivity in DLBCL cells, and combinatory drug screens revealed a synergistic effect of the BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, with platinum drugs at low concentrations. Applying local and external DLBCL cohorts, we addressed the clinical relevance of the genes identified in the CRISPR screens. BTK was among the most frequently mutated genes with a frequency of 3–5%, and XPA and ERCC6 were also mutated, albeit at lower frequencies. Furthermore, 27–54% of diagnostic DLBCL samples had mutations in pathways that can sensitize cells to cisplatin. In conclusion, this study shows that XPA and ERCC6, in addition to BTK, are essential for the response to platinum-based drugs in DLBCL.">

        <tr id="Abnormal cell proliferation and growth leading to cancer primarily result from cumulative genome mutations. Single gene mutations alone do not fully explain cancer onset and progression; instead, clustered mutations—simultaneous occurrences of multiple mutations—are considered to be pivotal in cancer development and advancement. These mutations can affect different genes and pathways, resulting in cells undergoing malignant transformation with multiple functional abnormalities. Clustered mutations influence cancer growth rates, metastatic potential, and drug treatment sensitivity. This summary highlights the various types and characteristics of clustered mutations to understand their associations with carcinogenesis and discusses their potential clinical significance in cancer. As a unique mutation type, clustered mutations may involve genomic instability, DNA repair mechanism defects, and environmental exposures, potentially correlating with responsiveness to immunotherapy. Understanding the characteristics and underlying processes of clustered mutations enhances our comprehension of carcinogenesis and cancer progression, providing new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for cancer.">

Drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells, a subset of cancer cells with the ability to survive and proliferate after exposure to therapeutic drugs, were generated. RNA sequencing was used to investigate the differential expression of lncRNAs, and the clinical relevance of lncRNAs was assessed in a cohort of lung adenocarcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Knockdown of these lncRNAs increases the sensitivity of the analyzed cell lines to therapeutic drugs. This study provides an opportunity to investigate the role of lncRNAs in the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying intrinsic resistance. Abstract Lung adenocarcinoma is the most prevalent form of lung cancer, and drug resistance poses a significant obstacle in its treatment. This study aimed to investigate the overexpression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as a mechanism that promotes intrinsic resistance in tumor cells from the onset of treatment. Drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells are a subset of cancer cells that survive and proliferate after exposure to therapeutic drugs, making them an essential object of study in cancer treatment. The molecular mechanisms underlying DTP cell survival are not fully understood; however, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed to play a crucial role. DTP cells from lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were obtained after single exposure to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; erlotinib or osimertinib). After establishing DTP cells, RNA sequencing was performed to investigate the differential expression of the lncRNAs. Some lncRNAs and one mRNA were overexpressed in DTP cells. The clinical relevance of lncRNAs was evaluated in a cohort of patients with lung adenocarcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). RT–qPCR validated the overexpression of lncRNAs and mRNA in the residual DTP cells and LUAD biopsies. Knockdown of these lncRNAs increases the sensitivity of DTP cells to therapeutic drugs. This study provides an opportunity to investigate the involvement of lncRNAs in the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that underlie intrinsic resistance. The identified lncRNAs and CD74 mRNA may serve as potential prognostic markers or therapeutic targets to improve the overall survival (OS) of patients with lung cancer.">

        <tr id="Male sex chromosome aneuploidies are frequent genetic aberrations in humans characterized by additional Y or X chromosome complements. Jacob (JS) and Klinefelter syndromes (KS), carrying 47,XYY and 47,XXY chromosomes, respectively, share several clinical features, including sterility, hormonal deficits, neurocognitive delay, and skeletal-muscle defects. Despite the high incidence, a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations in sex aneuploid patients is still elusive. In this study, we generated and characterized the inaugural cohort of 47,XYY human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We performed a comprehensive transcriptional analysis, including JS primary fibroblasts, iPSCs, and neural stem cells (NSCs) alongside KS cells. Our study revealed a transcriptional feedback mechanism tuning non-PAR X chromosome genes (NPX) homologs in Y supernumerary cells, a phenomenon not detected in X aneuploid iPSCs. By ectopically modulating the expression of selected NPY genes, we demonstrated a direct transcriptional link between the UTY-UTX gene pair. Furthermore, our analyses identified a shared transcriptomic signature between JS and KS, discernible already at the iPSC stage, with a notable enrichment for processes related to neurological functions. This transcriptomic convergence underscores potential commonalities in the molecular pathways underpinning the pathophysiology of male sex chromosome aneuploidies. Finally, through genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of JS iPSCs, we demonstrated that a supernumerary Y chromosome only minimally impacts the methylation status of 47,XYY cells at the pluripotent stage. Our work reveals critical transcriptional feedback mechanisms and shared gene expression signatures in male sex chromosome aneuploidies, paving the way for a better understanding of their common phenotypic features.">

        <tr id="Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is a widely used viral vector for gene therapy. Despite its clinical efficacy, the manufacturing of rAAV faces challenges in productivity and quality, leading to limited availability. To address the growing demand, next-generation process development should be informed by a mechanistic understanding of the cellular response to rAAV. In this study, we performed transcriptomic analysis of 5 cell lines with variable capacities for rAAV production. Using an intersectional approach, we assessed the transcriptional response to rAAV production and compared transcriptional profiles between high and baseline producers to identify possible targets for enhancing production. Modulation of cell cycle and nucleosome components suggested a reduction of proliferative capacity and a shift toward DNA replication to support rAAV production. During rAAV production, we observed upregulation of several core functions including transcription, stress response, and Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum organization. Conversely, inhibitors of DNA-binding proteins and mitochondrial components were consistently downregulated during rAAV production. We next performed a drug connectivity analysis of these results and identified 5 classes of drugs predicted to enhance rAAV production. Validation studies confirmed the efficacy of HDAC and microtubule inhibitors. Our data uncover novel and previously identified pathways that may enhance rAAV productivity, potentially enabling a path to engineer improved processes and cell lines for higher yields and better quality rAAV production.

        <tr id="Lung cancer patients treated with targeted therapies frequently respond well but invariably relapse due to the development of drug resistance. Drug resistance is in part mediated by a subset of cancer cells termed “drug-tolerant persisters” (DTPs), which enter a dormant, slow-cycling state that enables them to survive drug exposure. DTPs also exhibit stem cell-like characteristics, broad epigenetic reprogramming, altered metabolism, and a mutagenic phenotype mediated by adaptive mutability. While several studies have characterised the transcriptional changes that lead to the altered phenotypes exhibited in DTPs, these studies have focused predominantly on protein coding changes. As long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are also implicated in the phenotypes altered in DTPs, it is likely that they play a role in the biology of drug tolerance. In this review, we outline how lncRNAs may contribute to the key characteristics of DTPs, their potential roles in tolerance to targeted therapies, and the emergence of genetic resistance in lung adenocarcinoma.">

        <tr id="Tumors often show an initial response to chemotherapy, but then develop resistance, leading to relapse and poor prognosis. We hypothesized that a genomic comparison of mutations in pre-treated versus treatment-naive tumors would serve to identify genes that confer resistance. A challenge in such an analysis is that therapy alters mutation burdens and signatures, confounding association studies and complicating identifying causal, selected mutations. We developed DiffInvex, a framework for identifying changes in selection acting on individual genes in somatic genomes. Crucially, DiffInvex draws on a mutation rate baseline that accounts for these shifts in neutral mutagenesis during cancer evolution. We applied DiffInvex to 9,953 cancer whole-genomes from 29 cancer types from 8 studies, containing both WGS of treatment-naive tumors and tumors pre-treated by various drugs, identifying genes where point mutations are under conditional positive or negative selection for a certain chemotherapeutic, suggesting resistance mechanisms occurring via point mutation. DiffInvex confirmed well-known chemoresistance-driver mutations in EGFR, ESR1, KIT and AR genes as being under conditional positive selection, with additional cancer types identified for EGFR and KIT. Additionally, DiffInvex identified 11 genes with treatment-associated selection for different classes of therapeutics. In most cases, these genes were common cancer genes including PIK3CA, APC, MAP2K4 and MAP3K1. This suggests that tumor resistance to therapy via mutation often occurs via selective advantages conferred by known driver genes, rather than via mutations in specialized resistance genes. Various gene-chemotherapy associations were further supported in tests for functional impact of mutations, again implemented in a conditional selection setting, as well as replicating in independent panel or exome sequencing data. In addition to nominating drug resistance genes that could be targeted by future therapeutics, DiffInvex can also be applied to diverse analysis in cancer evolution, such as comparing normal and tumoral tissues, or analyzing subclonal evolution, identifying changes in selection over time.">

        <tr id="Dr. S. Shruthi, Prof. Dr. K. Bhasker Shenoy. Cisplatin (CDDP) is the first metal‐based drug and has been a popular drug in the treatment of various types of cancer for decades. Cancer cell death is promoted by this platinum‐based drug by generating DNA adducts and activating apoptotic signaling pathways. The development of drug resistance is the foremost clinical concern that compromises its efficacy. The mechanism of CDDP resistance encompasses changes in drug influx and efflux, drug accumulation reduction, enhanced drug detoxification, and repair which may affect its therapeutic value. Researchers have paid significant attention to overcoming CDDP resistance, which provides an opportunity to enhance clinical outcomes. Combinational therapy, use of CDDP analogs, phytochemicals, nanoparticle‐mediated drug delivery, gene targeting and regulation of drug induced epigenetic changes are the specific regimens to overcome CDDP resistance and treatment burden. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms involved in CDDP resistance and strategies considered to overcome these hurdles concerning preclinical and clinical studies. This may provide insights into the further development of novel approaches to uproot CDDP resistance, to ascertain a safer and more effective cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="RNA modification pathways are mis-regulated in multiple types of human cancer. To comprehensively identify cancer-relevant RNA modifications and their regulators, we screened all 150 annotated human RNA modifying proteins across 18 different normal and cancer cell lines using a CRISPR-based genetic knockout system. Fifty RNA modifying proteins were essential for survival of at least one cell type. A third of these essential genes were amplified in 38 different human primary cancer types and potentially drive cancer growth. Unexpectedly, the number of essential genes per cell line varied considerably, and this variation was not due to tissue of origin. Instead, we found that cancer cell-specific mitochondrial metabolic plasticity was responsible for the unique requirement of certain RNA modifications. For example, leukemia cells with high intrinsic drug tolerance required mitochondrial flexibility to survive treatment with the anti-leukemic drugs cytarabine and venetoclax. Synthetic lethality screens revealed that drug-resistance is abolished by deleting the mitochondrial methyltransferase TRMT5, which is responsible for the formation of N1-methylguanosine (m1G) in the tRNA anticodon loop. In summary, our study identifies cancer-relevant RNA modifying enzymes, and reveals a novel promising drug target for therapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia.">

Little is known about the basis of the variable genomic integrity among different PSC lines. Here we identify aneuploidies using RNA-seq and proteomics data from a panel of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines derived from 170 Diversity Outbred mice. We identified 62 lines with detectable aneuploid subpopulations and a subset of originally XX lines that lost one Chromosome X (XO). Strikingly, a much lower proportion of XX lines were aneuploid, compared to XY or XO lines. Two single-cell RNA-seq data sets demonstrated that aneuploid XY DO mESC also show lower Chromosome X gene expression and that XY mESC accumulate higher aneuploid proportions in culture than isogenic XX lines. Possible mechanisms for this protective effect of X chromosome dosage include our discovery that the lines with two active X Chromosomes have a higher expression of 2-cell-like state genes, and differential expression of X-linked tumor suppressor genes associated with DNA damage response.

From this family, we estimate an average of 192 DNMs per generation, including 75.5 de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 7.4 non-tandem repeat indels, 79.6 de novo indels or structural variants (SVs) originating from tandem repeats, 7.7 centromeric de novo SVs and SNVs, and 12.4 de novo Y chromosome events per generation. STRs and VNTRs are the most mutable with 32 loci exhibiting recurrent mutation through the generations. We accurately assemble 288 centromeres and six Y chromosomes across the generations, documenting de novo SVs, and demonstrate that the DNM rate varies by an order of magnitude depending on repeat content, length, and sequence identity. We show a strong paternal bias (75-81%) for all forms of germline DNM, yet we estimate that 17% of de novo SNVs are postzygotic in origin with no paternal bias. We place all this variation in the context of a high-resolution recombination map (∼3.5 kbp breakpoint resolution). We observe a strong maternal recombination bias (1.36 maternal:paternal ratio) with a consistent reduction in the number of crossovers with increasing paternal (r=0.85) and maternal (r=0.65) age. However, we observe no correlation between meiotic crossover locations and de novo SVs, arguing against non-allelic homologous recombination as a predominant mechanism. The use of multiple orthogonal technologies, near-telomere-to-telomere phased genome assemblies, and a multi-generation family to assess transmission has created the most comprehensive, publicly available “truth set” of all classes of genomic variants.

Sarcoma encompasses a diverse group of cancers that are typically resistant to current therapies, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The contexture of sarcomas limits generation of high-quality data using cutting-edge molecular profiling methods, such as single-cell RNA-seq, thus hampering progress in understanding these understudied cancers.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Here, we demonstrate feasibility of producing multi-modal single-cell genomics and whole-genome sequencing data from frozen tissues, profiling 75,716 cell transcriptomes of five undifferentiated pleomorphic (UPS) and three intimal sarcomas (INS) samples, including paired specimens from two patients treated with ICB.


RESULTS
We find that genomic diversity decreases in patients with response to ICB, and, in unbiased analyses, identify cancer cell programs associated with therapy resistance. Although interactions of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes within the tumor ecosystem increase in ICB responders, clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells alone was insufficient to predict drug responses.


CONCLUSION
This study provides a framework for studying rare tumors and identifies salient and treatment-associated cancer cell intrinsic and tumor-microenvironmental features in sarcomas.">

        <tr id="Whole-genome doubling (WGD) is a critical driver of tumor development and is linked to drug resistance and metastasis in solid malignancies. Here, we demonstrate that WGD is an ongoing mutational process in tumor evolution. Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing, we measured and modeled how WGD events are distributed across cellular populations within tumors and associated WGD dynamics with properties of genome diversification and phenotypic consequences of innate immunity. We studied WGD evolution in 65 high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) tissue samples from 40 patients, yielding 29,481 tumor cell genomes. We found near-ubiquitous evidence of WGD as an ongoing mutational process promoting cell-cell diversity, high rates of chromosomal missegregation, and consequent micronucleation. Using a novel mutation-based WGD timing method, doubleTime, we delineated specific modes by which WGD can drive tumor evolution: (i) unitary evolutionary origin followed by significant diversification, (ii) independent WGD events on a pre-existing background of copy number diversity, and (iii) evolutionarily late clonal expansions of WGD populations. Additionally, through integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that inflammatory signaling and cGAS-STING pathway activation result from ongoing chromosomal instability and are restricted to tumors that remain predominantly diploid. This contrasted with predominantly WGD tumors, which exhibited significant quiescent and immunosuppressive phenotypic states. Together, these findings establish WGD as an evolutionarily ‘active’ mutational process that promotes evolvability and dysregulated immunity in late stage ovarian cancer.">

        <tr id="Introduction Glioblastomas utilize malignant gene expression pathways to drive growth. Many of these gene pathways are not directly accessible with molecularly targeted pharmacological agents. Chromatin-modifying compounds can alter gene expression and target glioblastoma growth pathways. In this study, we utilize a systematic screen of chromatin-modifying compounds on a panel of patient-derived glioblastoma lines to identify promising compounds and their associated gene targets. Methods Five glioblastoma cell lines were subjected to a drug screen of 106 chromatin-modifying compounds representing 36 unique drug classes to determine the twelve most promising drug classes and the best candidate inhibitors in each class. These twelve drugs were then tested with a panel of twelve patient-derived gliomasphere lines to identify growth inhibition and corresponding gene expression patterns. Overlap analysis and weighted co-expression network analysis (WCGNA) were utilized to determine potential target genes and gene pathways. Results The initial drug screen identified twelve candidate pharmacologic agents for further testing. Drug sensitivity testing indicated an overall high degree of variability between gliomasphere lines. However, CPI203 was the most consistently effective compound, and the BET inhibitor class was the most consistently effective class of compounds across the gliomasphere panel. Correspondingly, most of the compounds tested had highly variable effects on gene expression between gliomasphere lines. CPI203 stood out as the only compound to induce a consistent effect on gene expression across different gliomasphere lines, specifically down-regulation of DNA-synthesis genes. Amongst the twelve tested cell lines, high expression of CDKN2A and CDKN2B distinguished more drug sensitive from more drug resistant lines. WCGNA identified two oncogenic gene modules (FBXO5 and MELK) that were effectively downregulated by CPI203 (FBXO5) and ML228 (FBXO5 and MELK). Conclusions The bromodomain inhibitor CPI203 induced relatively consistent effects on gene expression and growth across a variety of glioblastoma lines, specifically down-regulating genes associated with DNA replication. We propose that clinically effective BET inhibitors have the potential to induce consistent beneficial effects across a spectrum of glioblastomas.">

        <tr id="Transcription and splicing errors in cancer cells generate erroneous transcripts. Since erroneous transcripts are degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, whether they are junk or could be functional has been overlooked and understudied. We addressed this question by first performing a pan-cancer analysis and identified substantial erroneous noncoding transcripts (ENT) in cancers. Given that RNA/DNA binding domains (DBD) were predicted in ENTs, we deleted predicted DBDs in multiple ENTs in multiple cell lines, with RNA-sequencing and cell experiments before and after DBD deletion. DBD deletion caused significantly changed expression of ENTs’ target genes (whose promoter regions contain ENTs’ DNA binding sites, DBS) and changed cell migration and proliferation ability, indicating that many ENTs can transcriptionally regulate genes. Tightly coupled data analysis and experiments reveal that ENTs’ functions are highly cancer- and cellular-context specific, making ENTs a new class of safe and specific targets for noncoding RNA-based cancer therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BCa) is a major global health challenge, characterized by chromosomal instability (CIN) and subsequent acquisition of extensive somatic copy number alterations (CNAs). CNAs including amplifications and deletions, significantly influence intra-tumor heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Among these, the loss of chromosome 13q14.2 emerges as a considerable factor in BCa pathogenesis and treatment responses. We provide evidence that this genomic alteration is under positive selective pressure, correlating with poorer patient survival. Furthermore, through multi-omic and in vitro analyses, we uncover a dual role of 13q14.2 loss: it confers a survival advantage to tumor cells and modulate the cell cycle and pro-apoptotic pathways in cancer cells, affecting macrophages population in the TME, while paradoxically increasing tumor susceptibility to BCL2 inhibitors. These findings suggest that targeting 13q14.2 as a biomarker in BCa could enhance the efficacy of existing treatments and offer a new avenue for improving clinical outcomes in BCa. Figure 1.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Drug resistance is still an imminent issue for melanoma patients even after the use of BRAFi/MEKi combination therapy in clinic. Tumor heterogeneity and heterogeneity in treatment responses make it difficult to find consensus genes and pathways in resistance to therapy. This study used an objective method to analyze published gene expression data from pre-treated tumors and drug-resistant tumors, and identified possible targets and markers for resistant tumors, which centered on the PLXNC1 gene, which promotes a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Abstract Melanoma tumors exhibit a wide range of heterogeneity in genomics even with shared mutations in the MAPK pathway, including BRAF mutations. Consistently, adaptive drug resistance to BRAF inhibitors and/or BRAF plus MEK inhibitors also exhibits a wide range of heterogeneous responses, which poses an obstacle for discovering common genes and pathways that can be used in clinic for overcoming drug resistance. This study objectively analyzed two sets of previously published tumor genomics data comparing pre-treated melanoma tumors and BRAFi- and/or MEKi-resistant tumors. Heterogeneity in response to BRAFi and BRAFi/MEKi was evident because the pre-treated tumors and resistant tumors did not exhibit a tendency of clustering together. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis revealed eight genes and two related enriched signature gene sets (matrisome and matrisome-associated signature gene sets) shared by both sets of data. The matrisome was closely related to the tumor microenvironment and immune response, and five out of the eight shared genes were also related to immune response. The PLXNC1 gene links the shared gene set and the enriched signature gene sets as it presented in all analysis results. As the PLXNC1 gene was up-regulated in the resistant tumors, we validated the up-regulation of this gene in a laboratory using vemurafenib-resistant cell lines. Given its role in promoting inflammation, this study suggests that resistant tumors exhibit an inflammatory tumor microenvironment. The involvement of the matrisome and the specific set of immune genes identified in this study may provide new opportunities for developing future therapeutic methods.">

        <tr id="T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive leukemia predominantly affecting adolescents and young adults. T-ALL relapses are characterized by chemotherapy resistance, cellular heterogeneity and dismal outcome. To gain a deeper understanding of the cellular heterogeneity and mechanisms driving relapse, we conducted single-cell full-length RNA sequencing of 13 matched pediatric T-ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDX) samples obtained at initial diagnosis and relapse, generating the to date most comprehensive longitudinal single cell study in paired T-ALL samples, along with 5 non-relapsing PDX samples collected at initial diagnosis. This dataset identifies considerable transcriptomic diversity among individual T-ALL cell populations. Notably however, 11 of the 18 patients exhibit a small T-ALL cell subpopulation with a shared set of gene regulatory networks characterized by a common set of active regulons, expression patterns and splice isoforms. This profile involves the upregulation of a stem-like cell signature with enrichment of cell adhesion, and inhibition of the cell cycle and metabolic activity. Comprehensive investigations of these networks identify transcripts enforcing drug resistance through NF-κB expression and TGF-β signaling and of anti-apoptotic T cell signaling. Longitudinal monitoring of these stem-like cells demonstrates this subpopulation to account for only a small proportion of leukemia cells initially with a substantial expansion at relapse suggesting resistance to first line therapy. Chemotherapy resistance is functionally corroborated through in vitro and in vivo drug testing. We thus report the discovery of inherently treatment-resistant stem-like T-ALL cell populations underscoring the potential for devising future therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting stemness pathways in pediatric T-ALL. Key Points Single-cell full-length RNA sequencing reveals dormant, treatment-resistant cells expanding upon T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse. Stem-like T-ALL cells exhibit a shared gene regulatory network conferring chemotherapy resistance and relapse.">

        <tr id="CRISPR gene editing strategies are shaping cell therapies through precise and tunable control over gene expression. However, achieving reliable therapeutic effects with improved safety and efficacy requires informed target gene selection. This depends on a thorough understanding of the involvement of target genes in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that regulate cell phenotype and function. Machine learning models have been previously used for GRN reconstruction using RNA- seq data, but current techniques are limited to single cell types and focus mainly on transcription factors. This restriction overlooks many potential CRISPR target genes, such as those encoding extracellular matrix components, growth factors, and signaling molecules, thus limiting the applicability of these models for CRISPR strategies. To address these limitations, we have developed CRISPR-GEM, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based synthetic GRN constructed to accurately predict the downstream effects of CRISPR gene editing. First, input and output nodes are identified as differentially expressed genes between defined experimental and target cell/tissue types respectively. Then, MLP training learns regulatory relationships in a black-box approach allowing accurate prediction of output gene expression using only input gene expression. Finally, CRISPR-mimetic perturbations are made to each input gene individually and the resulting model predictions are compared to those for the target group to score and assess each input gene as a CRISPR candidate. The top scoring genes provided by CRISPR-GEM therefore best modulate experimental group GRNs to motivate transcriptomic shifts towards a target group phenotype. This machine learning model is the first of its kind for predicting optimal CRISPR target genes and serves as a powerful tool for enhanced CRISPR strategies across a range of cell therapies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is increasingly characterized by myriad genomic alterations beyond the well-known factors such as RAS, BRAF, and microsatellite instability (MSI). Novel genomic changes, including ERBB2 amplifications, mutations, and gene fusions, are now recognized as potential targets for precision therapy. This study aims to explore the genomic landscape of a Chinese cohort with mCRC to identify potentially targetable genetic alterations for personalized treatment strategies.


METHODS
A total of 500 mCRC patients in China were enrolled, based on which genomic profiling was performed using capture-based targeted sequencing across a panel of 520 genes on tumor tissues to identify prevalent genomic alterations. The mutations were analyzed by optimized proprietary algorithms. MSI and mismatch repair deficiency status were analyzed using the read-count-distribution approach. Besides, the overall survival (OS) related to these molecular changes was estimated.


RESULTS
The cohort's genomic profiling revealed TP53 mutations in 78%, APC in 60%, and KRAS in 47% of the patients. MSI-High status was confirmed in 5.8% of cases via a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based algorithm. ERBB2/HER2 amplifications were found in 12% (60/500) of patients, with potential therapeutic implications for those without concurrent KRAS mutations. A subset of patients (1.2%; 6/500) showed fusions and DNA damage response (DDR) gene mutations (except TP53) that could be targeted therapeutically. The KRAS (G12C) variant was detected in 14 patients (2.8%), and 61 (12.2%) had a BRAF V600E mutation. Notably, survival analysis showed no significant differences in OS between KRAS mutant loci and NRAS mutations (p = 0.436). However, BRAF V600E mutations were associated with a poorer prognosis than BRAF wild-type and non-V600E mutations (16.3 months vs. 29.5 and 31.1 months, respectively; p < 0.001).

        <tr id="Cell-cell interactions, which allow cells to communicate with each other through molecules in their microenvironment, are critical for the growth, health, and functions of cells. Previous studies show that drug-resistant cells can interact with drug-sensitive cells to elevate their drug resistance level, which is partially responsible for cancer recurrence. Studying protein targets and pathways involved in cell-cell communication provides essential information for fundamental cell biology studies and therapeutics of human diseases. In the current studies, we performed direct coculture and indirect coculture of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive cell lines, aiming to investigate intracellular proteins responsible for cell communication. Comparative studies were carried out using monoculture cells. Shotgun bottom-up proteomics results indicate that the P53 signaling pathway has a strong association with drug resistance mechanisms, and multiple TP53-related proteins were upregulated in both direct and indirect coculture systems. In addition, cell-cell communication pathways, including the phagosome and the HIF-signaling pathway, contribute to both direct and indirect coculture systems. Consequently, AK3 and H3-3A proteins were identified as potential targets for cell-cell interactions that are relevant to drug resistance mechanisms. We propose that the P53 signaling pathway, in which mitochondrial proteins play an important role, is responsible for inducing drug resistance through communication between drug-resistant and drug-sensitive cancer cells.">

        <tr id="Osteosarcoma is a rare primary bone tumor for which no significant therapeutic advancement has been made since the late 1980s despite ongoing efforts. Overall, the five-year survival rate remains about 65%, and is much lower in patients with tumors unresponsive to methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatin therapy. Genetic studies have not revealed actionable drug targets, but our group, and others, have reported that epigenomic biomarkers, including regulatory RNAs, may be useful prognostic tools for osteosarcoma. We tested if microRNA (miRNA) transcriptional patterns mark the transition from a chemotherapy sensitive to resistant tumor phenotype. Small RNA sequencing was performed using 14 patient matched pre-chemotherapy biopsy and post-chemotherapy resection high-grade osteosarcoma frozen tumor samples. Independently, small RNA sequencing was performed using 14 patient matched biopsy and resection samples from untreated tumors. Separately, miRNA specific Illumina DASL arrays were used to assay an independent cohort of 65 pre-chemotherapy biopsy and 26 patient matched post-chemotherapy resection formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor samples. mRNA specific Illumina DASL arrays were used to profile 37 pre-chemotherapy biopsy and five post-chemotherapy resection FFPE samples, all of which were also used for Illumina DASL miRNA profiling. The National Cancer Institute Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments dataset, including PCR based miRNA profiling and RNA-seq data for 86 and 93 pre-chemotherapy tumor samples, respectively, was also used. Paired differential expression testing revealed a profile of 17 miRNAs with significantly different transcriptional levels following chemotherapy. Genes targeted by the miRNAs were differentially expressed following chemotherapy, suggesting the miRNAs may regulate transcriptional networks. Finally, an in vitro pharmacogenomic screen using miRNAs and their target transcripts predicted response to a set of candidate small molecule therapeutics which potentially reverse the chemotherapy resistance phenotype and synergize with chemotherapy in otherwise treatment resistant tumors. Importantly, these novel therapeutic targets are distinct from targets identified by a similar pharmacogenomic analysis of previously published prognostic miRNA profiles from pre chemotherapy biopsy specimens.">

        <tr id="Resistance to cancer therapy is driven by both cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental factors. Previous work has revealed that multiple resistant cell fates emerge in melanoma following treatment with targeted therapy and that, in vitro, these resistant fates are determined by the transcriptional state of individual cells prior to exposure to treatment. What remains unclear is whether these resistant fates are shared across different genetic backgrounds and how, if at all, these resistant fates interact with the tumor microenvironment. Through spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing, we uncovered distinct resistance programs in melanoma cells shaped by both intrinsic cellular states and the tumor microenvironment. Consensus non-negative matrix factorization revealed shared intrinsic resistance programs across different cell lines, highlighting the presence of universal and unique resistance pathways. In patient samples, we demonstrated that these resistance programs coexist within individual tumors and associate with diverse immune signatures, suggesting that the tumor microenvironment and distribution of resistant fates are closely connected. Single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomics in xenograft models revealed both intrinsically determined and extrinsically influenced resistant fates. Overall, this work demonstrates that each therapy resistant fate coexists with a distinct immune microenvironment in tumors and that, in vivo, tissue features, such as regions of necrosis, can influence which resistant fate is adopted.">

Hepatocellular carcinoma, comprising approximately 90% of cases, presents a formidable challenge with a less than 20% 5-year survival rate despite recent treatment advancements. The impediments of drug resistance and off-target effects underscore the critical need for innovative and efficacious therapies. Harnessing the growing understanding of RNA function offers a promising avenue to address previously "undruggable" proteins, transcripts, and genes. Various RNAs demonstrate the potential to selectively act on these targets, expanding the scope of therapeutic interventions. With diverse regulatory roles in cancer pathways, RNAs emerge as valuable targets and tools for anticancer therapy development.

Herein, we employed the PEmax system to create a library of 297,900 epegRNAs and performed extensive screening to identify synonymous mutations that impact cell fitness. While most synonymous mutations are neutral, we found that some can elicit phenotypic effects. By developing a specialized machine learning tool, we uncovered their impact on various biological processes such as mRNA splicing and transcription, supported by multifaceted experimental evidence. Notably, synonymous mutations can alter RNA folding and affect translation, as demonstrated by PLK1_S2. By integrating screening data with our model, we successfully predicted clinically deleterious synonymous mutations.

With the advances in genome sequencing technology, mutational profiling on a genome-wide scale has become readily accessible, and our knowledge of the genomic consequences of HRD has been greatly expanded and refined. Here, we review the recent advances in HRD detection methods. We examine the copy number and structural alterations that often accompany the genome instability that results from HRD, describe the advantages of mutational signature-based methods that do not rely on specific gene mutations, and review some of the existing algorithms used for HRD detection. We also discuss the choice of sequencing platforms (panel, exome, or whole-genome) and catalog the HRD detection assays used in key PARP inhibitor trials.">

        <tr id="Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technique has enabled detailed analysis of gene expression at the single cell level, enhancing the understanding of subtle mechanisms that underly pathologies and drug resistance. To derive such biological meaning from sequencing data in oncology, some critical processing must be performed, including identification of the tumor cells by markers and algorithms that infer copy number variations (CNVs). We compared the performance of sciCNV, InferCNV, CopyKAT and SCEVAN tools that identify tumor cells by inferring CNVs from scRNA-seq data. Sequencing data from Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients, adjacent and healthy tissues were analyzed, and the predicted tumor cells were compared to those identified by well-assessed PDAC markers. Results from InferCNV, CopyKAT and SCEVAN overlapped by less than 30% with InferCNV showing the highest sensitivity (0.72) and SCEVAN the highest specificity (0.75). We show that the predictions are highly dependent on the sample and the software used, and that they return so many false positives hence are of little use in verifying or filtering predictions made via tumor biomarkers. We highlight how critical this processing can be, warn against the blind use of these software and point out the great need for more reliable algorithms.">

        <tr id="Abstract Currently, cancer is still a leading cause of human death globally. Tumor deterioration comprises multiple events including metastasis, therapeutic resistance and immune evasion, all of which are tightly related to the phenotypic plasticity especially epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity (EMP). Tumor cells with EMP are manifest in three states as epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), partial EMT, and mesenchymal–epithelial transition, which orchestrate the phenotypic switch and heterogeneity of tumor cells via transcriptional regulation and a series of signaling pathways, including transforming growth factor‐β, Wnt/β‐catenin, and Notch. However, due to the complicated nature of EMP, the diverse process of EMP is still not fully understood. In this review, we systematically conclude the biological background, regulating mechanisms of EMP as well as the role of EMP in therapy response. We also summarize a range of small molecule inhibitors, immune‐related therapeutic approaches, and combination therapies that have been developed to target EMP for the outstanding role of EMP‐driven tumor deterioration. Additionally, we explore the potential technique for EMP‐based tumor mechanistic investigation and therapeutic research, which may burst vigorous prospects. Overall, we elucidate the multifaceted aspects of EMP in tumor progression and suggest a promising direction of cancer treatment based on targeting EMP.">

        <tr id="Prostate cancer (PCa) poses significant challenges in treatment, particularly when it progresses to a metastatic, castrate-resistant state. Conventional therapies, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal treatments, often fail due to toxicities, off-target effects, and acquired resistance. This research perspective defines an alternative therapeutic strategy focusing on the metabolic vulnerabilities of PCa cells, specifically their reliance on non-essential amino acids such as cysteine. Using an engineered enzyme cyst(e)inase to deplete the cysteine/cystine can induce oxidative stress and DNA damage in cancer cells. This depletion elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, disrupts glutathione synthesis, and enhances DNA damage, leading to cancer cell death. The combinatorial use of cyst(e)inase with agents targeting antioxidant defenses, such as thioredoxins, further amplifies ROS accumulation and cytotoxicity in PCa cells. Overall, in this perspective provides a compressive overview of the previous work on manipulating amino acid metabolism and redox balance modulate the efficacy of DNA repair-targeted and immune checkpoint blockade therapies in prostate cancer.">

        <tr id="Melanoma being one of the most common and deadliest skin cancers, has been rising since the past decade. Patients at advanced stages of the disease have very poor prognoses, as opposed to at the earlier stages. Nowadays the standard-of-care of advanced melanoma is resection followed by immune checkpoint inhibition based immunotherapy. However, a substantial proportion of patients either do not respond or develop resistances. This underscores a need for novel approaches and therapeutic targets as well as a better understanding of the mechanisms of melanoma pathogenesis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a poorly characterized class of functional players and promising targets in promoting malignancy. Certain lncRNAs have been identified to play integral roles in melanoma progression and drug resistances, however systematic screens to uncover novel functional lncRNAs are scarce. Here, we profile differentially expressed lncRNAs in patient derived short-term metastatic cultures and BRAF-MEK-inhibition resistant cells. We conduct a focused growth-related CRISPR-inhibition screen of overexpressed lncRNAs, validate and functionally characterize lncRNA hits with respect to cellular growth, invasive capacities and apoptosis in vitro as well as the transcriptomic impact of our lead candidate the novel lncRNA XLOC_030781. In sum, we extend the current knowledge of ncRNAs and their potential relevance on melanoma. Significance Previously considered as transcriptional noise, lncRNAs have emerged as novel players in regulating many cellular aspects in health and disease including melanoma. However, the number and as well as the extent of functional significance of most lncRNAs remains elusive. We provide a comprehensive strategy to identify functionally relevant lncRNAs in melanoma by combining expression profiling with CRISPR-inhibition growths screens lowering the experimental effort. We also provide a larger resource of differentially expressed lncRNAs with potential implications in melanoma growth and invasion. Our results broaden the characterized of lncRNAs as potential targets for future therapeutic applications.">

        <tr id="Abstract Recently, the cancer community has gained a heightened awareness of the roles of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in cancer proliferation, drug resistance and epigenetic remodeling. However, a hindrance to studying ecDNA is the lack of available cancer model systems that express ecDNA. Increasing our awareness of which model systems express ecDNA will advance our understanding of fundamental ecDNA biology and unlock a wealth of potential targeting strategies for ecDNA-driven cancers. To bridge this gap, we created CytoCellDB, a resource that provides karyotype annotations for cell lines within the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). We identify 139 cell lines that express ecDNA, a 200% increase from what is currently known. We expanded the total number of cancer cell lines with ecDNA annotations to 577, which is a 400% increase, covering 31% of cell lines in CCLE/DepMap. We experimentally validate several cell lines that we predict express ecDNA or homogeneous staining regions (HSRs). We demonstrate that CytoCellDB can be used to characterize aneuploidy alongside other molecular phenotypes, (gene essentialities, drug sensitivities, gene expression). We anticipate that CytoCellDB will advance cytogenomics research as well as provide insights into strategies for developing therapeutics that overcome ecDNA-driven drug resistance.">

        <tr id="The genome of a cell is continuously battered by a plethora of exogenous and endogenous processes that can lead to damaged DNA. Repair mechanisms correct this damage most of the time, but failure to do so leaves mutations. Mutations do not occur in random manner, but rather typically follow a more or less specific pattern due to known or imputed mutational processes. Mutational signature analysis is the process by which the predominant mutational process can be inferred for a cancer and can be used in several contexts to study both the genesis of cancer and its response to therapy. Recent pan-cancer genomic efforts such as "The Cancer Genome Atlas" have identified numerous mutational signatures that can be categorized into single base substitutions, doublet base substitutions, or small insertions/deletions. Understanding these mutational signatures as they occur in non-small lung cancer could improve efforts at prevention, predict treatment response to personalized treatments, and guide the development of therapies targeting tumor evolution. For non-small cell lung cancer, several mutational signatures have been identified that correlate with exposures such as tobacco smoking and radon and can also reflect endogenous processes such as aging, APOBEC activity, and loss of mismatch repair. Herein, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of mutational signatures in non-small lung cancer.">

        <tr id="The fitness effects of new mutations determine key properties of evolutionary processes. Beneficial mutations drive evolution, yet selection is also shaped by the frequency of small-effect deleterious mutations, whose combined effect can burden otherwise adaptive lineages and alter evolutionary trajectories and outcomes in clonally evolving organisms such as viruses, microbes, and tumors. The small effect sizes of these important mutations have made accurate measurements of their rates difficult. In microbes, assessing the effect of mutations on growth can be especially instructive, as this complex phenotype is closely linked to fitness in clonally evolving organisms. Here, we perform high-throughput time-lapse microscopy on cells from mutation-accumulation strains to precisely infer the distribution of mutational effects on growth rate in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that mutational effects on growth rate are overwhelmingly negative, highly skewed towards very small effect sizes, and frequent enough to suggest that deleterious hitchhikers may impose a significant burden on evolving lineages. By using lines that accumulated mutations in either wild-type or slippage repair-defective backgrounds, we further disentangle the effects of 2 common types of mutations, single-nucleotide substitutions and simple sequence repeat indels, and show that they have distinct effects on yeast growth rate. Although the average effect of a simple sequence repeat mutation is very small (approximately 0.3%), many do alter growth rate, implying that this class of frequent mutations has an important evolutionary impact.">

        <tr id="Abstract Androgen receptor- (AR-) indifference is a mechanism of resistance to hormonal therapy in prostate cancer (PC). Here we demonstrate that ONECUT2 (OC2) activates resistance through multiple drivers associated with adenocarcinoma, stem-like and neuroendocrine (NE) variants. Direct OC2 gene targets include the glucocorticoid receptor (GR; NR3C1) and the NE splicing factor SRRM4, which are key drivers of lineage plasticity. Thus, OC2, despite its previously described NEPC driver function, can indirectly activate a portion of the AR cistrome through epigenetic activation of GR. Mechanisms by which OC2 regulates gene expression include promoter binding, enhancement of genome-wide chromatin accessibility, and super-enhancer reprogramming. Pharmacologic inhibition of OC2 suppresses lineage plasticity reprogramming induced by the AR signaling inhibitor enzalutamide. These results demonstrate that OC2 activation promotes a range of drug resistance mechanisms associated with treatment-emergent lineage variation in PC and support enhanced efforts to therapeutically target OC2 as a means of suppressing treatment-resistant disease.">

        <tr id="A central challenge in the quest for precise gene regulation within mammalian cells is the development of regulatory networks that can achieve perfect adaptation-where outputs consistently return to a set baseline post-stimulus. Here, we present such a system that leverages the CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and anti-CRISPR proteins as two antithetic elements to establish perfect adaptation in mammalian cells and dynamically regulate gene expression. We demonstrate that this system can maintain stable expression levels of target genes in the face of external perturbations, thus providing a robust platform for biological applications. The versatility of our system is further showcased through its integration with endogenous regulatory mechanisms in T cells, such as the NF-κB-mediated immune response, and its ability to program apoptosis responses for precise spatial and temporal control of cellular growth and death. This study not only advances our understanding of gene regulation in mammalian cells but also opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention, particularly in diseases characterized by dysregulated gene expression.">

        <tr id="Kirsten Rat Sarcoma (KRAS) is the most commonly mutated oncogene in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). We have previously reported the interactions between microsatellite instability (MSI), DNA promoter methylation, and gene expression. In this study, we looked for associations between KRAS mutation, gene expression, and methylation that may help with precision medicine. Genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation were done in paired CRC tumor and surrounding healthy tissues. The results suggested that (a) the magnitude of dysregulation of many major gene pathways in CRC was significantly greater in patients with the KRAS mutation, (b) the up- and down-regulation of these dysregulated gene pathways could be correlated with the corresponding hypo- and hyper-methylation, and (c) the up-regulation of CDKN2A was more pronounced in tumors with the KRAS mutation. A recent cell line study showed that there were higher CDKN2A levels in 5-FU-resistant CRC cells and that these could be down-regulated by Villosol. Our findings suggest the possibility of a better response to anti-CDKN2A therapy with Villosol in KRAS-mutant CRC. Also, the more marked up-regulation of genes in the proteasome pathway in CRC tissue, especially with the KRAS mutation and MSI, may suggest a potential role of a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib, carfilzomib, or ixazomib) in selected CRC patients if necessary.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer with diverse genetic variations and DNA methylation alterations. By studying the interaction of gene mutations, expression, and DNA methylation, we aimed to gain valuable insights into the processes that lead to block differentiation in AML. We analyzed TCGA-LAML data (173 samples) with RNA sequencing and DNA methylation arrays, comparing FLT3 mutant (48) and wild-type (125) cases. We conducted differential gene expression analysis using cBioPortal, identified DNA methylation differences with ChAMP tool, and correlated them with gene expression changes. Gene set enrichment analysis (g:Profiler) revealed significant biological processes and pathways. ShinyGo and GeneCards were used to find potential transcription factors and their binding sites among significant genes. We found significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) negatively correlated with their most significant methylation probes (Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.49, P-value <0.001) between FLT3 mutant and wild-type groups. Moreover, our exploration of 450 k CpG sites uncovered a global hypo-methylated status in 168 DEGs. Notably, these methylation changes were enriched in the promoter regions of Homebox superfamily gene, which are crucial in transcriptional-regulating pathways in blood cancer. Furthermore, in FLT3 mutant AML patient samples, we observed overexpress of WT1, a transcription factor known to bind homeobox gene family. This finding suggests a potential mechanism by which WT1 recruits TET2 to demethylate specific genomic regions. Integrating gene expression and DNA methylation analyses shed light on the impact of FLT3 mutations on cancer cell development and differentiation, supporting a two-hit model in AML. This research advances understanding of AML and fosters targeted therapeutic strategy development.">

Single-cell-omics datasets provide unprecedented resource to empowers analysis on CP. Hematopoiesis offers fertile opportunities to develop quantitative methods for understanding CP with rich supports from experimental ground-truths. In this study we generated high-quality lineage-negative (Lin−) single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets under various conditions and introduced a working pipeline named Snapdragon to interrogate naïve and disturbed plasticity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with mutational or environmental challenges. Utilizing embedding methods UMAP or FA, a continuum of hematopoietic development is visually observed in wildtype where the pipeline confirms a very low Proportion of hybrid-cells (Phc, with bias range: 0.4-0.6) on a transition trajectory. Upon Tet2 mutation, a driver of leukemia, or treatment of DSS, an inducer of colitis, Phc is increased and plasticity of HSPCs was enhanced. Quantitative analysis indicates that Tet2 mutation enhances HSC self-renewal capability while DSS treatment results in an enhanced myeloid-skewing trajectory, suggesting their similar but different consequences. We prioritized several transcription factors (i.e the EGR family) and signaling pathways (i.e. receptors IL1R1 and ADRB, inflammation and sympathy-sensing respectively) which are responsible for Phc alterations. CellOracle-based simulation suggests that knocking-out EGR regulons or pathways of IL1R1 and ADRB partially reverses Phc promoted by Tet2 mutation and inflammation.

        <tr id="Antibiotic resistance is the leading cause of death globally, with a higher possibility of the emergence of highly resistant pathogens, leading to epidemics. Several antibiotic resistance mechanisms have been discovered, such as enhanced efflux of antibiotics, reduced influx of antibiotics, alteration of antibiotics or their targets, and adaptation to antibiotics. However, this mechanism cannot fully explain the development of antibiotic resistance because the genes associated with this mechanism have been elucidated. However, the factors governing their regulation are not yet fully understood. Recent studies have highlighted the epigenetic and epitranscriptomic roles of antibiotic resistance development-associated genes. Epigenetic modification is associated with DNA modification, whereas epitranscriptomic modification is associated with RNA modification to control gene expression by regulating various biological phenomena such as splicing, translation, and stability. Therefore, this review will focus on the discovery of epigenetic modifications, particularly by DNA methyltransferases, such as restriction-modification (R-M) systems associated with methyltransferases, orphan DNA methyltransferases, and nucleoid-associated proteins that contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance. This scrutinization further expands to epitranscriptomic modification of non-coding RNA, which has a role in the regulation of antibiotic resistance. Epitranscriptomic modification of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which is a major target of antibiotics, has been well explored. while non-coding RNA such as cis and trans small non coding RNA, and riboswitches are poorly explored. This epigenetic and epitranscriptomic modification will help to understand the regulation of antibiotic resistance-associated genes, which will help to identify key regulators of antibiotic resistance, paving the way for new antibiotic discovery, leading to decreased antibiotic mortality globally.">

        <tr id="Therapy-induced acquired resistance limits the clinical effectiveness of mutation-specific RAS inhibitors in colorectal cancer. It is unknown whether broad-spectrum active-state RAS inhibitors meet similar limitations. Here, we identify and categorize mechanisms of resistance to the broad-spectrum active-state RAS inhibitor RMC-7977 in colorectal cancer cell lines. We found that KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer cell lines are universally sensitive to RMC-7977, inhibiting the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK axis, halting proliferation and in some cases inducing apoptosis. To monitor KRAS downstream effector pathway activity, we developed a compartment-specific dual-color ERK activity reporter. RMC-7977 treatment reduced reporter activity. However, long-term dose escalation with RMC-7977 revealed multiple patterns of reporter reactivation in emerging resistant cell populations that correlated with phosphorylation states of compartment-specific ERK targets. Cells sorted for high, low, or cytoplasmic reporter activity exhibited distinct patterns of genomic mutations, phospho-protein, and transcriptional activities. Notably, all resistant subpopulations showed dynamic ERK regulation in the presence of the RAS inhibitor, unlike the parental sensitive cell lines. High levels of RAS downstream activities were observed in cells characterized by a KRAS Y71H resistance mutation. In contrast, RAS inhibitor-resistant populations with low, or cytoplasmic ERK reporter reactivation displayed different genetic alterations, among them RAF1 S257L and S259P mutations. Colorectal cancer cells resistant to RMC-7977 and harboring the RAF1 mutation specifically exhibited synergistic sensitivity to concurrent RAS and RAF inhibition. Our findings endorse reporter-assisted screening together with single-cell analyses as a powerful approach for dissecting the complex landscape of therapy resistance. The strategy offers opportunities to develop clinically relevant combinatorial treatments to counteract emergence of resistant cancer cells.">

Additionally, we detected 122 SNVs in 88 genes, with all lines acquiring at least one de novo SNV during culture. Our findings show higher loads of both CNVs and SNVs at later passages which are due to the cumulative acquisition of mutations over a longer time in culture and not to an increased rate of mutagenesis over time. Importantly, we observed that SNVs and rare CNVs follow the acquisition of chromosomal gains in 1q and 20q, while most of the low-passage and genetically balanced samples were devoid cancer-associated mutations. This suggests that the recurrent chromosomal abnormalities are the potential drivers for the acquisition of other mutations.">

        <tr id="Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease, in which a number of genetic and epigenetic changes occur in tumor onset and progression. Recent studies indicate that changes at the RNA level are also involved in tumorigenesis, such as adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing. Here, we systematically investigate transcriptome-wide A-to-I editing events in a large number of samples from Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). Using a computational pipeline that determines significant differences in editing level between NHL and normal samples at known A-to-I editing sites, we identify a number of differentially edited editing sites between NHL subtypes and normal samples. Most of the differentially edited sites are located in non-coding regions, and many such sites show a strong correlation between gene expression level and editing efficiency, indicating that RNA editing might have direct consequences for the cancer cell’s aberrant gene regulation status in these cases. Moreover, we establish a strong link between RNA editing and NHL by demonstrating that NHL and normal samples and even NHL subtypes can be distinguished based on genome-wide RNA editing profiles alone. Our study establishes a strong link between RNA editing, cancer and aberrant gene regulation in NHL.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Aneuploidy, the presence of an aberrant number of chromosomes, has been associated with tumorigenesis for over a century. More recently, advances in karyotyping techniques have revealed its high prevalence in cancer: About 90% of solid tumors and 50–70% of hematopoietic cancers exhibit chromosome gains or losses. When analyzed at the level of specific chromosomes, there are strong patterns that are observed in cancer karyotypes both pan-cancer and for specific cancer types. These specific aneuploidy patterns correlate strongly with outcomes for tumor initiation, progression, metastasis formation, immune evasion and resistance to therapeutic treatment. Despite their prominence, understanding the basis underlying aneuploidy patterns in cancer has been challenging. Advances in genetic engineering and bioinformatic analyses now offer insights into the genetic determinants of aneuploidy pattern selection. Overall, there is substantial evidence that expression changes of particular genes can act as the positive selective forces for adaptation through aneuploidy. Recent findings suggest that multiple genes contribute to the selection of specific aneuploid chromosomes in cancer; however, further research is necessary to identify the most impactful driver genes. Determining the genetic basis and accompanying vulnerabilities of specific aneuploidy patterns is an essential step in selectively targeting these hallmarks of tumors.">

        <tr id="We adapted a previously developed targeted single-nucleus DNA sequencing (snDNA-seq) method and constructed a new suite of computational analysis tools to study 137,491 single-nucleus DNA libraries from 24 pancreatic cancers collected under a variety of clinical scenarios including early and late diagnoses, different metastatic sites and before- and after-treatment. We refined the mutational landscape of pancreatic cancer by capturing events missed by bulk sequencing, and validated the evolution pattern of early fixation of driver single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) followed by generation of intratumoral heterogeneity for copy number variations (CNVs). Intertumoral convergent evolution was common, including subclonal inactivation of TGF-β pathway by mutating various components of it; intratumoral convergence was rarely observed, likely due to strong selective force in pancreatic cancer development. Continuous evolution was frequently seen manifesting as CNVs. In the context of non-targeted treatments, no particular pattern was found across metastases or through treatment. In six pancreatic cancers with germline BRCA2 mutation, we discovered varied timing of biallelic inactivation of BRCA2, which sculpted different evolutionary trajectories and could presumably contribute to differential response to treatment. As the first large-scale application of targeted snDNA-seq on pancreatic cancer, this work provides a sample processing and computational analysis pipeline that warrants further clinical utility.">

        <tr id="Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common B-cell malignancy in the Western world, characterized by frequent relapses despite temporary remissions. Our study integrated publicly available proteomic, transcriptomic, and patient survival datasets to identify key differences between healthy and CLL samples. We exposed approximately 1000 proteins that differentiate healthy from cancerous cells, with 608 upregulated and 415 downregulated in CLL cases. Notable upregulated proteins include YEATS2 (an epigenetic regulator), PIGR (Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor), and SNRPA (a splicing factor), which may serve as prognostic biomarkers for this disease. Key pathways implicated in CLL progression involve RNA processing, stress resistance, and immune response deficits. Furthermore, we identified three existing drugs—Bosutinib, Vorinostat, and Panobinostat—for potential further investigation in drug repurposing in CLL. We also found limited correlation between transcriptomic and proteomic data, emphasizing the importance of proteomics in understanding gene expression regulation mechanisms. This generally known disparity highlights once again that mRNA levels do not accurately predict protein abundance due to many regulatory factors, such as protein degradation, post-transcriptional modifications, and differing rates of translation. These results demonstrate the value of integrating omics data to uncover deregulated proteins and pathways in cancer and suggest new therapeutic avenues for CLL.">

        <tr id="Populations of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum regularly confront orchestrated changes in frontline drug treatment that drastically alter the parasite’s selection landscape. When this has occurred, the parasite has successfully adapted to the new drugs through novel resistance mutations. These novel mutations, however, may emerge in a genetic background already shaped by prior drug selection. In some instances, selection imposed by distinct drugs has targeted the same loci in either synergistic or antagonistic ways, resulting in genomic signatures that can be hard to attribute to a specific agent. Here, we use two approaches for detecting sequential bouts of drug adaptation: haplotype-based selection testing and temporal changes in allele frequencies. Using a set of longitudinally acquired samples from French Guiana, we determine that since the introduction of the drug artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in 2007 there have been rapid hard selective sweeps at both known and novel loci. We additionally identify genomic regions where selection acted in opposing directions before and after widespread AL introduction. At four high-profile genes with demonstrated involvement in drug resistance (crt, mdr1, aat1, and gch1), we saw strong selection before and after drug regime change; however, selection favored different haplotypes in the two time periods. Similarly, the allele frequency analysis identified coding variants whose frequency trajectory changed sign under the new drug pressure. These selected alleles were enriched for genes implicated in artemisinin and/or partner drug resistance in other global populations. Overall, these results suggest that drug resistance in P. falciparum is governed by known alleles of large effect along with a polygenic architecture of more subtle variants, any of which can experience fitness reversals under distinct drug regimes.">

Failure to accomplish an effective DDS/DDR mechanism can lead to cell death or otherwise to cell transformation and cancer development. microRNAs (miRs) are short noncoding RNAs that primarily function as micromanagers of gene expression. Herein, we aimed to investigate the links between miRs and the translation of specific mRNAs encoding proteins involved in genomic DDS and DDR and to screen drugs that have high binding affinity to the selected miRs, which may serve as cancer therapeutics. To accomplish these aims, we used a variety of computational methods spanning data analysis, molecular modeling, and simulation tools (i.e., PyRx, Biopython, ViennaRNA, RNAComposer, AutoDock Vina, OpenBabel, PyMOL, Discovery Studio, MarvinSketch). The genes and miRNAs involved in the DDS and DDR mechanisms were retrieved from either the literature or various online databases (e.g., miRDB). miR data were further cleaned and prepared using scripts, and various libraries were used to obtain their 3-D structures. Genes interacting with miRs were enriched based on multiple database annotations using Enrichr KG. Then, we used docking analyses to virtually screen compounds to serve as ligands for the miRs. Finally, we generated gene-disease-miR-drug networks to study the linkages between the compounds and miR molecules under investigation. For the first time, we were able to identify five compounds that could be repurposed for downregulating miRs that are linked to inhibition of translation of mRNA involved in the DDS and DDR processes. The gathered candidate drugs can be useful for preventing cell transformation and cancer development.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Germline mutations have been identified in a small number of hereditary cancers, but the genetic predisposition for many familial cancers remains to be elucidated. Methods This study identified a Chinese pedigree that presented different cancers (breast cancer, BRCA; adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction, AEG; and B‐cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B‐ALL) in each of the three generations. Whole‐genome sequencing and whole‐exome sequencing were performed on peripheral blood or bone marrow and cancer biopsy samples. Whole‐genome bisulfite sequencing was conducted on the monozygotic twin brothers, one of whom developed B‐ALL. Results According to the ACMG guidelines, bioinformatic analysis of the genome sequencing revealed 20 germline mutations, particularly mutations in the DNAH11 (c.9463G > A) and CFH (c.2314G > A) genes that were documented in the COSMIC database and validated by Sanger sequencing. Forty‐one common somatic mutated genes were identified in the cancer samples, displaying the same type of single nucleotide substitution Signature 5. Meanwhile, hypomethylation of PLEK2, MRAS, and RXRA as well as hypermethylation of CpG island associated with WT1 was shown in the twin with B‐ALL. Conclusions These findings reveal genomic alterations in a pedigree with multiple cancers. Mutations found in the DNAH11, CFH genes, and other genes predispose to malignancies in this family. Dysregulated methylation of WT1, PLEK2, MRAS, and RXRA in the twin with B‐ALL increases cancer susceptibility. The similarity of the somatic genetic changes among the three cancers indicates a hereditary impact on the pedigree. These familial cancers with germline and somatic mutations, as well as epigenomic alterations, represent a common molecular basis for many multiple cancer pedigrees.">

        <tr id="Alterations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene are the most frequent driver mutations in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), linked to a high risk of relapse in patients with internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the FLT3 protein are approved for clinical use, yet resistance often emerges. This resistance is mainly seen following the acquisition of additional point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), resulting in a double mutant FLT3-ITD/TKD, which sustains cell signalling and survival despite the presence of FLT3 inhibitors. Here, we developed a FLT3-mutant AML model with adaptive resistance to type II TKIs, sorafenib, and quizartinib by in vitro drug selection. Through global multiomic profiling, we identified upregulation of proteins involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, particularly NADPH-oxidases, driving cellular ’ROS-addiction’, with resistant cells relying on ROS for survival, and genome fidelity preserved by ATM-driven DNA repair. Transcriptomic analysis of adult and paediatric AML (pAML) patients identified high ATM expression as a biomarker for shorter median overall survival in both the de novo and relapsed settings. Inhibition of ATM with clinically relevant therapy WSD-0628 effectively killed TKI- and chemotherapy-resistant AML cells in vitro and significantly extended the survival of mice with sorafenib- and quizartinib-resistant FLT3-ITD AML in vivo. We propose a new treatment strategy to improve survival of patients who develop resistance to sorafenib and quizartinib, as well as relapsed and refractory pAML, exploiting resistance mechanisms to precision therapies and cell-intrinsic features of high-risk cases, highlighting a clinically relevant salvage strategy.">

        <tr id="Drug resistance is currently one of the biggest challenges in cancer treatment. With the deepening understanding of drug resistance, various mechanisms have been revealed, including metabolic reprogramming and alterations of redox balance. Notably, metabolic reprogramming mediates the survival of tumor cells in harsh environments, thereby promoting the development of drug resistance. In addition, the changes during metabolic pattern shift trigger reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which in turn regulates cellular metabolism, DNA repair, cell death, and drug metabolism in direct or indirect ways to influence the sensitivity of tumors to therapies. Therefore, the intersection of metabolism and ROS profoundly affects tumor drug resistance, and clarifying the entangled mechanisms may be beneficial for developing drugs and treatment methods to thwart drug resistance. In this review, we will summarize the regulatory mechanism of redox and metabolism on tumor drug resistance and highlight recent therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic–redox circuits, including dietary interventions, novel chemosynthetic drugs, drug combination regimens, and novel drug delivery systems.">

        <tr id="Endometrial cancer (EC) is a devastating and common disease affecting women’s health. The NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program predicted that there would be >66,000 new cases in the United States and >13,000 deaths from EC in 2023, and EC is the sixth most common cancer among women worldwide. Regulation of mitochondrial metabolism plays a role in tumorigenesis. In proliferating cancer cells, mitochondria provide the necessary building blocks for biosynthesis of amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, and glucose. One mechanism causing altered mitochondrial activity is mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation. The polyploid human mtDNA genome is a circular double-stranded molecule essential to vertebrate life that harbors genes critical for oxidative phosphorylation plus mitochondrial-derived peptide genes. Cancer cells display aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, which arises from the needs of fast-dividing cells and is characterized by increased glucose uptake and conversion of glucose to lactate. Solid tumors often contain at least one mtDNA substitution. Furthermore, it is common for cancer cells to harbor mixtures of wild-type and mutant mtDNA genotypes, known as heteroplasmy. Considering the increase in cancer cell energy demand, the presence of functionally relevant carcinogenesis-inducing or environment-adapting mtDNA mutations in cancer seems plausible. We review 279 EC tumor-specific mtDNA single nucleotide variants from 111 individuals from different studies. Many transition mutations indicative of error-prone DNA polymerase γ replication and C to U deamination events were present. We examine the spectrum of mutations and their heteroplasmy and discuss the potential biological impact of recurrent, non-synonymous, insertion, and deletion mutations. Lastly, we explore current EC treatments, exploiting cancer cell mitochondria for therapy and the prospect of using mtDNA variants as an EC biomarker.">

        <tr id="The search for genetic variants that act as causative factors in human diseases by disrupting the normal splicing process has primarily focused on single nucleotide variants (SNVs). It is worth noting that insertions or deletions (indels) have also been sporadically reported as causative disease variants through their potential impact on the splicing process. In this study, to perform identification of indels inducing exon extension/shrinkage events, we used individual-specific genomes and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data pertaining to the corresponding individuals and identified 12 exon extension/shrinkage events that were potentially induced by indels that disrupted authentic splice sites or created novel splice sites in 235 normal individuals. By evaluating the impact of these abnormal splicing events on the resulting transcripts, we found that five events led to the generation of premature termination codons (PTCs), including those occurring within genes associated with genetic disorders. Our analysis revealed that the potential functions of indels have been underexamined, and it is worth considering the possibility that indels may affect splice site usage, using RNA-seq data to discover novel potentially disease-associated mutations.">

        <tr id="Background: Cellular senescence in response to ionizing radiation (IR) limits the replication of damaged cells by causing permanent cell cycle arrest. However, IR can induce pro-survival signaling pathways that reduce the extent of radiation-induced cytotoxicity and promote the development of radioresistance. The differential incorporation of histone variant H2A.J has profound effects on higher-order chromatin organization and on establishing the epigenetic state of radiation-induced senescence. However, the precise epigenetic mechanism and function of H2A.J overexpression in response to IR exposure still needs to be elucidated. Methods: Primary (no target, NT) and genetically modified fibroblasts overexpressing H2A.J (H2A.J-OE) were exposed to 20 Gy and analyzed 2 weeks post-IR for radiation-induced senescence by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence microscopy. Transcriptome signatures were analyzed in (non-)irradiated NT and H2A.J-OE fibroblasts by RNA sequencing. Since H2A.J plays an important role in the epidermal homeostasis of human skin, the oncogenic potential of H2A.J was investigated in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). The tissue microarrays of cSCC were analyzed for H2A.J protein expression pattern by automated image analysis. Results: In response to radiation-induced DNA damage, the overexpression of H2A.J impairs the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), thereby inhibiting the SAHF-mediated silencing of proliferation-promoting genes. The dysregulated activation of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases disturbs cell cycle arrest in irradiated H2A.J-OE fibroblasts, thereby overcoming radiation-induced senescence. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed significantly increased WNT16 signaling in H2A.J OE fibroblasts after IR exposure, promoting the fundamental mechanisms of tumor development and progression, including the activation of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition. The quantitative analysis of cSCCs revealed that undifferentiated tumors are associated with high nuclear H2A.J expression, related with greater oncogenic potential. Conclusion: H2A.J overexpression induces radioresistance and promotes oncogenic transformation through the activation of WNT16 signaling pathway functions. H2A.J-associated signatures may improve risk stratification by identifying patients with more aggressive cSCC who may require radiotherapy with increased doses.">

        <tr id="DNA methylation is a key epigenetic regulatory mechanism that plays a critical role in a variety of cellular processes, including the regulation of cell fate during development, maintenance of cell identity, and genome stability. DNA methylation is tightly regulated by enzymatic reactions and its deregulation plays an important role in the development of cancer. Specific DNA methylation alterations have been found in pediatric solid tumors, providing new insights into the development of these tumors. In addition, DNA methylation profiles have greatly contributed to tune the diagnosis of pediatric solid tumors and to define subgroups of patients with different risks of progression, leading to the reduction in unwanted toxicity and the improvement of treatment efficacy. This review highlights the dysregulated DNA methylome in pediatric solid tumors and how this information provides promising targets for epigenetic therapies, particularly inhibitors of DNMT enzymes (DNMTis). Opportunities and limitations are considered, including the ability of DNMTis to induce viral mimicry and immune signaling by tumors. Besides intrinsic action against cancer cells, DNMTis have the potential to sensitize immune-cold tumors to immunotherapies and may represent a remarkable option to improve the treatment of challenging pediatric solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has a poor survival rate for both pediatric and adult patients due to its frequent relapse. To elucidate the bioenergetic principle underlying AML relapse, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial–nuclear dual genomes responsible for metabolic plasticity in treatment-resistant blasts. Both the gain and loss of function results demonstrated that NFκB2, a noncanonical transcription factor (TF) of the NFκB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) family, can control the expression of TFAM (mitochondrial transcription factor A), which is known to be essential for metabolic biogenesis. Furthermore, genetic tracking and promoter assays revealed that NFκB2 is in the mitochondria and can bind the specific “TTGGGGGGTG” region of the regulatory D-loop domain to activate the light-strand promoter (LSP) and heavy-strand promoter 1 (HSP1), promoters of the mitochondrial genome. Based on our discovery of NFκB2′s novel function of regulating mitochondrial–nuclear dual genomes, we explored a novel triplet therapy including inhibitors of NFκB2, tyrosine kinase, and mitochondrial ATP synthase that effectively eliminated primary AML blasts with mutations of the FMS-related receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and displayed minimum toxicity to control cells ex vivo. As such, effective treatments for AML must include strong inhibitory actions on the dual genomes mediating metabolic plasticity to improve leukemia prognosis.">

We demonstrate that targeted single-molecule chromatin fiber sequencing (Fiber-seq) achieves this, permitting single-molecule, long-read genomic and epigenomic profiling across targeted >100 kilobase loci with ∼10-fold enrichment over untargeted sequencing. Targeted Fiber-seq reveals that pathogenic expansions of the DMPK CTG repeat that underlie Myotonic Dystrophy 1 are characterized by somatic instability and disruption of multiple nearby regulatory elements, both of which are repeat length-dependent. Furthermore, we reveal that therapeutic adenine base editing of the segmentally duplicated γ-globin (HBG1/HBG2) promoters in primary human hematopoietic cells induced towards an erythroblast lineage increases the accessibility of the HBG1 promoter as well as neighboring regulatory elements. Overall, we find that these non-protein coding mosaic variants can have complex impacts on chromatin architectures, including extending beyond the regulatory element harboring the variant.">

        <tr id="Background and aim. Lung cancer remains one of the most threatening malignancies, ranking as the second most diagnosed cancer, and it continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Challenges persist with late diagnosis and the high mutational burden characteristic of lung cancer. 
Methods. Our study focuses on identifying the mutational spectrum of a cohort of advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients using a minimally invasive method through blood collection. To analyze the mutational landscape of these patients, we employed plasma DNA for the next-generation sequencing (NGS) cancer panel Ion Torrent, which contains 50 of the most mutated genes in lung cancer. All protocols for extraction, quality and quantity control, and library preparation follow the manufacturer’s rules. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to select pathogenic mutations versus non-pathogenic-benign ones. 
Results. This approach is particularly valuable for patients in advanced stages (III and IV, n=10) of lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, who lack surgical options and limited therapeutic avenues. The comprehensive sequencing analysis revealed that nine of the ten lung cancer patients carried a TP53 mutation. Also, several other mutations exist in various cases, showing heterogeneous profiling. 
Conclusions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of liquid biopsies in providing crucial genetic insights that can guide personalized treatment strategies, improving the management and outcomes for patients with advanced lung cancer.">

While risk stratification improved by identifying cytogenetic lesions, prognostication remains inadequate with 30% of standard-risk patients experiencing relapse within 5 years. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) enabled the interrogation of malignant cell heterogeneity in pAML and characterization of the immune microenvironment. Herein we report the largest pAML scRNAseq analysis to date with 708,285 cells from 164 bone marrow biopsies of 95 patients and 11 healthy controls. We uncovered treatment-resistant (TR) subtypes of pAML specific to RUNX1-RUNX1T1, FLT3-ITD, and CBFB-MYH11 patients. The enrichment of TR subtype gene signatures on the TARGET pAML data supported an association with significantly poor outcomes. Intriguingly, in addition to leukemic stem cells, we identified mast cell-like pAML associated with treatment resistance and poor outcomes. Together, immature and mature pAML subtypes are promising biomarkers for identifying patients at increased risk of relapse within cytogenetic categories.">

Additionally, we explored the potential and limitations of epigenetics-related target molecules in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of cancer metastasis.">

        <tr id="Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is a form of a circular double-stranded DNA that exists independently of conventional chromosomes. eccDNA exhibits a broad and random distribution across eukaryotic cells and has been associated with tumor-related properties due to its ability to harbor the complete gene information of oncogenes. The complex and multifaceted mechanisms underlying eccDNA formation include pathways such as DNA damage repair, breakage–fusion–bridge (BFB) mechanisms, chromothripsis, and cell apoptosis. Of note, eccDNA plays a pivotal role in tumor development, genetic heterogeneity, and therapeutic resistance. The high copy number and transcriptional activity of oncogenes carried by eccDNA contribute to the accelerated growth of tumors. Notably, the amplification of oncogenes on eccDNA is implicated in the malignant progression of cancer cells. The improvement of high-throughput sequencing techniques has greatly enhanced our knowledge of eccDNA by allowing for a detailed examination of its genetic structures and functions. However, we still lack a comprehensive and efficient annotation for eccDNA, while challenges persist in the study and understanding of the functional role of eccDNA, emphasizing the need for the development of robust methodologies. The potential clinical applications of eccDNA, such as its role as a measurable biomarker or therapeutic target in diseases, particularly within the spectrum of human malignancies, is a promising field for future research. In conclusion, eccDNA represents a quite dynamic and multifunctional genetic entity with far-reaching implications in cancer pathogenesis and beyond. Further research is essential to unravel the molecular pathways of eccDNA formation, elucidate its functional roles, and explore its clinical applications. Addressing these aspects is crucial for advancing our understanding of genomic instability and developing novel strategies for tailored therapeutics, especially in cancer.">

        <tr id="Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a highly prevalent and incurable form of cancer that arises from malignant plasma cells, with over 35,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States. While there are a growing number of approved therapies, MM remains incurable and nearly all patients will relapse and exhaust all available treatment options. Mechanisms for disease progression are unclear and in particular, little is known regarding the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) in mediating disease progression and response to treatment. In this study, we used transcriptome sequencing to compare newly diagnosed MM patients who had short progression- free survival (PFS) to standard first-line treatment (PFS < 24 months) to patients who had prolonged PFS (PFS > 24 months). We identified 157 differentially upregulated lncRNAs with short PFS and focused our efforts on characterizing the most upregulated lncRNA, LINC01432. We investigated LINC01432 overexpression and CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown in MM cell lines to show that LINC01432 overexpression significantly increases cell viability and reduces apoptosis, while knockdown significantly reduces viability and increases apoptosis, supporting the clinical relevance of this lncRNA. Next, we used individual-nucleotide resolution cross-linking immunoprecipitation with RT-qPCR to show that LINC01432 directly interacts with the RNA binding protein, CELF2. Lastly, we showed that LINC01432-targeted locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides reduce viability and increases apoptosis. In summary, this fundamental study identified lncRNAs associated with short PFS to standard NDMM treatment and further characterized LINC01432, which inhibits apoptosis. Key points: lncRNA expression was found to be dysregulated in patients with short PFS to standard multiple myeloma therapy. LINC01432-bound CELF2 inhibits apoptosis.">

        <tr id="Abnormal transcription initiation from alternative first exon has been reported to promote tumorigenesis. However, the prevalence and impact of gene expression regulation mediated by alternative tandem transcription initiation were mostly unknown in cancer. Here, we developed a robust computational method to analyze alternative tandem transcription start site (TSS) usage from standard RNA sequencing data. Applying this method to pan-cancer RNA sequencing datasets, we observed widespread dysregulation of tandem TSS usage in tumors, many of which were independent of changes in overall expression level or alternative first exon usage. We showed that the dynamics of tandem TSS usage was associated with epigenomic modulation. We found that significant 5′ untranslated region shortening of gene TIMM13 contributed to increased protein production, and up-regulation of TIMM13 by CRISPR-mediated transcriptional activation promoted proliferation and migration of lung cancer cells. Our findings suggest that dysregulated tandem TSS usage represents an addtional layer of cancer-associated transcriptome alterations.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) is an important regulator of ErbB-mediated pathways involved in cancer development. Recently, there have been several studies analyzing NRG-1 gene fusions engaged in altering the dimerization of HER family proteins and the consecutive results of their activation in different types of cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients can benefit from pan-HER inhibitors, and knowledge of NRG-1 fusions can help tailor the treatment to a specific group of patients. New drugs targeting cells with NRG-1 fusions are under clinical trials and show effectiveness in NSCLC treatment. Abstract Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presents a variety of druggable genetic alterations that revolutionized the treatment approaches. However, identifying new alterations may broaden the group of patients benefitting from such novel treatment options. Recently, the interest focused on the neuregulin-1 gene (NRG1), whose fusions may have become a potential predictive factor. To date, the occurrence of NRG1 fusions has been considered a negative prognostic marker in NSCLC treatment; however, many premises remain behind the targetability of signaling pathways affected by the NRG1 gene. The role of NRG1 fusions in ErbB-mediated cell proliferation especially seems to be considered as a main target of treatment. Hence, NSCLC patients harboring NRG1 fusions may benefit from targeted therapies such as pan-HER family inhibitors, which have shown efficacy in previous studies in various cancers, and anti-HER monoclonal antibodies. Considering the increased interest in the NRG1 gene as a potential clinical target, in the following review, we highlight its biology, as well as the potential clinical implications that were evaluated in clinics or remained under consideration in clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Objective The escape from T cell-mediated immune surveillance is an important cause of death for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study aims to identify clonal heterogeneity in leukemia progenitor cells and explore molecular or signaling pathways associated with AML immune escape. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to identified AML-related cellular subsets, and intercellular communication was analyzed to investigate molecular mechanisms associated with AML immune escape. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to hematopoietic stem cell progenitors (HSC-Prog) in AML, and critical ore signaling pathways and hub genes were found by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. The mRNA level of the hub gene was verified using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the protein level of human leukocyte antigen A (HLA-A) using enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). Results scRNA-seq analysis revealed a large heterogeneity of HSC-Prog across samples, and the intercellular communication analysis indicated a strong association between HSC-Prog and CD8+-T cells, and HSC-Prog also had an association with HLA-A. Transcriptome analysis identified 1748 DEGs, enrichment analysis results showed that non-classical wnt signaling pathway was associated with AML, and 4 pathway-related genes (RHOA, RYK, CSNK1D, NLK) were obtained. After qRT-PCR and ELISA validation, hub genes and HLA-A were found to be down-regulated in AML and up-regulated after activation of the non-classical Wnt signaling pathway. Conclusion In this study, clonal heterogeneity of HSC-Prog cells in AML was identified, non-classical wnt signaling pathways associated with AML were identified, and it was verified that HLA-A could be upregulated by activation of non-classical wnt signaling, thereby increasing antigen presentation.">

        <tr id="Cancer cells show remarkable plasticity and can switch lineages in response to the tumor microenvironment. Cellular plasticity drives invasiveness and metastasis and helps cancer cells to evade therapy by developing resistance to radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Increased understanding of cell fate determination through epigenetic reprogramming is critical to discover how cancer cells achieve transcriptomic and phenotypic plasticity. Glioblastoma is a perfect example of cancer evolution where cells retain an inherent level of plasticity through activation or maintenance of progenitor developmental programs. However, the principles governing epigenetic drivers of cellular plasticity in glioblastoma remain poorly understood. Here, using machine learning (ML) we employ cross-patient prediction of transcript expression using a combination of epigenetic features (ATAC-seq, CTCF ChIP-seq, RNAPII ChIP-seq, H3K27Ac ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq) of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). We investigate different ML and deep learning (DL) models for this task and build our final pipeline using XGBoost. The model trained on one patient generalizes to another one suggesting that the epigenetic signals governing gene transcription are consistent across patients even if GSCs can be very different. We demonstrate that H3K27Ac is the epigenetic feature providing the most significant contribution to cross-patient prediction of gene expression. In addition, using H3K27Ac signals from patients-derived GSCs, we can predict gene expression of human neural crest stem cells suggesting a shared developmental epigenetic trajectory between subpopulations of these malignant and benign stem cells. Our cross-patient ML/DL models determine weighted patterns of influence of epigenetic marks on gene expression across patients with glioblastoma and between GSCs and neural crest stem cells. We propose that broader application of this analysis could reshape our view of glioblastoma tumor evolution and inform the design of new epigenetic targeting therapies.">

        <tr id="Linking disease phenotypes with molecular targets is key to the rational design of treatment interventions. Resistance to the chemotherapeutic cisplatin is one of the major factors limiting the clinical utility of this therapy, which is central to the treatment of a variety of solid malignancies. In this study, we couple the upregulation of a chemoresistant factor, the glutamate-cystine antiporter SLC7A11, with the addiction of cisplatin-resistant cancer cells to extracellular glutamine. In doing so, we thus provide a putative biomarker for this acquired metabolic dependency of chemoresistance. Subsequently, we evaluate various therapeutic strategies to selectively kill SLC7A11high cisplatin-resistant cancer cells, identifying cross-resistance to ferroptosis-inducing compounds and hypersensitivity to glutaminase inhibitor CB-839. We identify enzymatic depletion of extracellular glutamine using the long-standing anti-leukemic therapy asparaginase (ASNase), which possesses glutaminase activity, as a potential approach, and show this can be successfully combined with cisplatin in cell models. In summary, this study mechanistically links an acquired metabolic dependency of chemoresistant cancer cells with a putative biomarker and provides a potentially actionable strategy to target these drug resistant cells warranting further investigation.">

        <tr id="Cancer stem cells (CSCs) possess a significant ability to renew themselves, which gives them a strong capacity to form tumors and expand to encompass additional body areas. In addition, they possess inherent resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapies used to treat many forms of cancer. Scientists have focused on investigating the signaling pathways that are highly linked to the ability of CSCs to renew themselves and maintain their stem cell properties. The pathways encompassed are Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, hedgehog, STAT3, NF-κB, PI-3K/Akt/mTOR, sirtuin, ALDH, MDM2, and ROS. Recent studies indicate that directing efforts towards CSC cells is essential in eradicating the overall cancer cell population and reducing the likelihood of tumor metastasis. As our comprehension of the mechanisms that stimulate CSC activity, growth, and resistance to chemotherapy advances, the discovery of therapeutic drugs specifically targeting CSCs, such as small-molecule compounds, holds the potential to revolutionize cancer therapy. This review article examines and analyzes the novel anti-CSC compounds that have demonstrated effective and selective targeting of pathways associated with the renewal and stemness of CSCs. We also discussed their special drug metabolism and absorption mechanisms. CSCs have been the subject of much study in cancer biology. As a possible treatment for malignancies, small-molecule drugs that target CSCs are gaining more and more attention. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current state of key small-molecule compounds, summarizes their recent developments, and anticipates the future discovery of even more potent and targeted compounds, opening up new avenues for cancer treatment.">

We find that cells can harbor >1,000 regulatory elements with haplotype-selective chromatin accessibility (HSCA) and show that these elements preferentially localize to genomic loci containing the most human genetic diversity, with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus showing the largest amount of HSCA genome-wide in immune cells. Furthermore, we uncover HSCA elements with sequence non-deterministic chromatin accessibility, representing likely somatic epimutations, and show that productive transcription from the inactive X chromosome is buttressed by clustered promoter-proximal elements that escape X chromosome inactivation.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive and lethal form of brain cancer with few effective treatments. In this context, Zika virus has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent due to its ability to selectively infect and kill GBM cells. To elucidate these mechanisms and expand the landscape of oncolytic virotherapy, we pursued a transcriptomic meta-analysis comparing the molecular signatures of Zika infection in GBM and neuroblastoma (NBM). Over-representation analysis of dysregulated coding genes showed significant enrichment of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), NF-κB, and p53 signaling pathways. A refined list of long non-coding RNAs consistently dysregulated in Zika-infected GBMs was also developed. Functional review of these candidates revealed their potential regulatory role in Zika-mediated oncolysis. We performed validation of the less-researched targets in adult and pediatric GBM cell lines and found significant differential regulation, as predicted. Altogether, our results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of Zika on GBM. We highlight potential therapeutic targets that could be further interrogated to improve the efficacy of tumor cell death and the utility of Zika as an adjuvant virotherapy for GBM and other related cancers.">

        <tr id="RNA viruses have notoriously high mutation rates due to error-prone replication by their RNA polymerase. However, natural selection concentrates variability in a few key viral proteins. To test whether this stems from different mutation tolerance profiles among viral proteins, we measured the effect of >40,000 non-synonymous mutations across the full proteome of coxsackievirus B3 as well as >97% of all possible codon deletions in the nonstructural proteins. We find significant variation in mutational tolerance within and between individual viral proteins, which correlated with both general and protein-specific structural and functional attributes. Furthermore, mutational fitness effects remained stable across cell lines, suggesting selection pressures are mostly conserved across environments. In addition to providing a rich dataset for understanding virus biology and evolution, our results illustrate that incorporation of mutational tolerance data into druggable pocket discovery can aid in selecting targets with high barriers to drug resistance.">

        <tr id="Cells must adapt to environmental changes to maintain homeostasis. One of the most striking environmental adaptations is entry into hibernation during which core body temperature can decrease from 37°C to as low at 4°C. How mammalian cells, which evolved to optimally function within a narrow range of temperatures, adapt to this profound decrease in temperature remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted the first genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen in cells derived from Syrian hamster, a facultative hibernator, as well as human cells to investigate the genetic basis of cold tolerance in a hibernator and a non-hibernator in an unbiased manner. Both screens independently revealed glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a selenium-containing enzyme, and associated proteins as critical for cold tolerance. We utilized genetic and pharmacological approaches to demonstrate that GPX4 is active in the cold and its catalytic activity is required for cold tolerance. Furthermore, we show that the role of GPX4 as a suppressor of cold-induced cell death extends across hibernating species, including 13-lined ground squirrels and greater horseshoe bats, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of this mechanism of cold tolerance. This study identifies GPX4 as a central modulator of mammalian cold tolerance and advances our understanding of the evolved mechanisms by which cells mitigate cold-associated damage—one of the most common challenges faced by cells and organisms in nature.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of upper and lower motor neurons with an unknown etiology. The difficulty of recovering biological material from patients led to employ lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) as a model for ALS because many pathways, typically located in neurons, are also activated in these cells.


METHODS
To investigate the expression of coding and long non-coding RNAs in LCLs, a transcriptomic profiling of sporadic ALS (SALS) and mutated patients (FUS, TARDBP, C9ORF72 and SOD1) and matched controls was realized. Thus, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were investigated among the different subgroups of patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and immortalized into LCLs via Epstein-Barr virus infection; RNA was extracted, and RNA-sequencing analysis was performed.


RESULTS
Gene expression profiles of LCLs were genetic-background-specific; indeed, only 12 genes were commonly deregulated in all groups. Nonetheless, pathways enriched by DEGs in each group were also compared, and a total of 89 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) terms were shared among all patients. Eventually, the similarity of affected pathways was also assessed when our data were matched with a transcriptomic profile realized in the PBMCs of the same patients.


CONCLUSIONS
We conclude that LCLs are a good model for the study of RNA deregulation in ALS.">

        <tr id="The expression of eukaryotic genes relies on the precise 3’-terminal cleavage and polyadenylation of newly synthesized pre-mRNA transcripts. Defects in these processes have been associated with various diseases, including cancer. While cancer-focused sequencing studies have identified numerous driver mutations in protein-coding sequences, noncoding drivers – particularly those affecting the cis-elements required for pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation – have received less attention. Here, we systematically analysed cancer somatic mutations affecting 3’UTR polyadenylation signals using the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) dataset. We found a striking enrichment of cancer-specific somatic mutations that disrupt strong and evolutionarily conserved cleavage and polyadenylation signals within tumour suppressor genes. Further bioinformatics and experimental analyses conducted as a part of our study suggest that these mutations have a profound capacity to downregulate the expression of tumour suppressor genes. Thus, this work uncovers a novel class of noncoding somatic mutations with significant potential to drive cancer progression.">

Cisplatin constitutes an integral part of standard cervical cancer treatment approaches. However, despite initial patient response, de novo or delayed/acquired treatment resistance is often reported, and toxicity is of concern. Chemotherapy resistance is associated with major alterations in genomic, metabolomic, epigenetic and proteomic landscapes.

Patients diagnosed with the same clinical stage and pathological classification may have different prognoses and therapeutic responses due to alterations in molecular genetics. As an essential marker for the molecular subtyping of breast cancer, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in gene expression regulation, cell differentiation, and the maintenance of genomic stability. Here, we developed a modular framework for lncRNA identification and applied it to a breast cancer cohort to identify novel lncRNAs not previously annotated. To investigate the potential biological function, regulatory mechanisms, and clinical relevance of the novel lncRNAs, we elucidated the genomic and chromatin features of these lncRNAs, along with the associated protein-coding genes and putative enhancers involved in the breast cancer regulatory networks. Furthermore, we uncovered that the expression patterns of novel and annotated lncRNAs identified in breast cancer were related to the hormone response in the PAM50 subtyping criterion, as well as the immune response and progression states of breast cancer across different immune cells and immune checkpoint genes. Collectively, the comprehensive identification and functional analysis of lncRNAs revealed that these lncRNAs play an essential role in breast cancer by altering gene expression and participating in the regulatory networks, contributing to a better insight into breast cancer heterogeneity and potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis is a druggable metabolic dependency of cancer cells, and chemotherapy agents targeting pyrimidine metabolism are the backbone of treatment for many cancers. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is an essential enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway that can be targeted by clinically approved inhibitors. However, despite robust preclinical anticancer efficacy, DHODH inhibitors have shown limited single-agent activity in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Therefore, novel combination therapy strategies are necessary to realize the potential of these drugs. To search for therapeutic vulnerabilities induced by DHODH inhibition, we examined gene expression changes in cancer cells treated with the potent and selective DHODH inhibitor brequinar (BQ). This revealed that BQ treatment causes upregulation of antigen presentation pathway genes and cell surface MHC class I expression. Mechanistic studies showed that this effect is (1) strictly dependent on pyrimidine nucleotide depletion, (2) independent of canonical antigen presentation pathway transcriptional regulators, and (3) mediated by RNA polymerase II elongation control by positive transcription elongation factor B (P-TEFb). Furthermore, BQ showed impressive single-agent efficacy in the immunocompetent B16F10 melanoma model, and combination treatment with BQ and dual immune checkpoint blockade (anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1) significantly prolonged mouse survival compared to either therapy alone. Our results have important implications for the clinical development of DHODH inhibitors and provide a rationale for combination therapy with BQ and immune checkpoint blockade.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer, the fifth most prevalent cancer worldwide, is often diagnosed in advanced stages with limited treatment options. Examining the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its metabolic reprogramming can provide insights for better diagnosis and treatment. This study investigates the link between TME factors and metabolic activity in gastric cancer using bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We identified two molecular subtypes in gastric cancer by analyzing the distinct expression patterns of 81 prognostic genes related to the TME and metabolism, which exhibited significant protein-level interactions. The high-risk subtype had increased stromal content, fibroblast and M2 macrophage infiltration, elevated glycosaminoglycans/glycosphingolipids biosynthesis, and fat metabolism, along with advanced clinicopathological features. It also exhibited low mutation rates and microsatellite instability, associating it with the mesenchymal phenotype. In contrast, the low-risk group showed higher tumor content and upregulated protein and sugar metabolism. We identified a 15-gene prognostic signature representing these characteristics, including CPVL, KYNU, CD36, and GPX3, strongly correlated with M2 macrophages, validated through single-cell analysis and an internal cohort. Despite resistance to immunotherapy, the high-risk group showed sensitivity to molecular targeted agents directed at IGF-1R (BMS-754807) and the PI3K-mTOR pathways (AZD8186, AZD8055). We experimentally validated these promising drugs for their inhibitory effects on MKN45 and MKN28 gastric cells. This study unveils the intricate interplay between TME and metabolic pathways in gastric cancer, offering potential for enhanced diagnosis, patient stratification, and personalized treatment. Understanding molecular features in each subtype enriches our comprehension of gastric cancer heterogeneity and potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Studies on somatic mutations in cloned animals have revealed slight genetic variances between clones and their originals, but have yet to identify the precise effects of these differences within the organism. Somatic mutations contribute to aging and are implicated in tumor development and other age-related diseases. Thus, we compared whole genome sequencing data from an original dog with that of cloned dogs, identifying candidate somatic mutations that were disproportionately located within genes previously implicated in aging. The substitutional signature of cloning-specific somatic mutations mirrored the uniform distribution characteristic of the signature associated with human aging. Further analysis of genes revealed significant enrichment of traits associated with body size as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal function and tumorigenesis. Overall, the somatic mutations found in cloned dogs may indicate a conserved mechanism driving aging across species and a broad spectrum of pathway alterations.">

Among them, LINC00518, a recently identified lncRNA encoded by a gene located on chromosome 6p24.3, consists of three exons and is predicted to positively regulate the expression of specific genes. LINC00518 has emerged as a key oncogenic lncRNA in multiple cancer types. It exerts its tumor-promoting effects by modulating the expression of several target genes, primarily through acting as a sponge for microRNAs (miRNAs). Additionally, LINC00518 influences critical signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin, JAK/STAT, and integrin β3/FAK pathways. Elevated levels of LINC00518 in tumor tissues are associated with increased tumor size, advanced clinical stage, metastasis, and poor survival prognosis. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the genetic characteristics, expression patterns, biological functions, and underlying mechanisms of LINC00518 in human diseases.">

To understand the functional genomic roles of DNA modifications, it is critical to accurately map their diverse chemical forms with single-nucleotide precision in complex genomes, but it remains challenging. Click-code-seq is a click-chemistry-aided single-nucleotide-resolution strategy for guanine-oxidation mapping, used in yeast DNA but having poor applicability to human genomes. Here, we upgraded click-code-seq to enable its first application for sequencing DNA oxidation and depurination in human genomes. For this, we developed a companion fluorescence assay, click-fluoro-quant, to rapidly quantify different common DNA modifications, and devised novel adapters to minimize false modification detection and assess modification frequency in cell populations. We uncovered that endogenous DNA oxidation in a human cell line has a highly similar pattern to cancer mutational signatures associated with reactive oxygen species. We established that the DNA-alkylating chemotherapy drug irofulven preferentially induces depurination in ApA dimers and promoter regions. Intriguingly, we revealed that oxidized guanines and apurinic sites, both irofulven-induced and endogenous, are depleted in gene transcribed strands, and the strand bias widens with increasing gene expression. This work substantially advances click-code-seq for deciphering the impacts of key modifications in human DNA on cellular physiology and toxicological responses.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain cancer characterized by significant molecular and cellular heterogeneity, which complicates treatment efforts. Current standard therapies, including surgical resection, radiation, and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, often fail to achieve long-term remission due to tumor recurrence and resistance. A pro-oxidant environment is involved in glioma progression, with oxidative stress contributing to the genetic instability that leads to gliomagenesis. Evaluating pro-oxidant therapies in brain tumors is crucial due to their potential to selectively target and eradicate cancer cells by exploiting the elevated oxidative stress levels inherent in these malignant cells, thereby offering a novel and effective strategy for overcoming resistance to conventional therapies. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of doxorubicin (DOX) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) with Me-ALA, focusing on their effects on redox homeostasis. Basal ROS levels and antioxidant gene expression (NFE2L2, CAT, GSR) were quantitatively assessed across GBM cell lines, revealing significant variability probably linked to genetic differences. DOX and PDT treatments, both individually and in combination, were analyzed for their efficacy in inducing oxidative stress and cytotoxicity. An in silico analysis further explored the relationship between gene mutations and oxidative stress in GBM patients, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying treatment responses. Our findings suggest that pro-oxidant therapies, such as DOX and PDT in combination, could selectively target GBM cells, highlighting a promising avenue for improving therapeutic outcomes in GBM.">

        <tr id="RNAs undergo a complex choreography of metabolic processes in human cells that are regulated by thousands of RNA-associated proteins. While the effects of individual RNA-associated proteins on RNA metabolism have been extensively characterized, the full complement of regulators for most RNA metabolic events remain unknown. Here we present a massively parallel RNA-linked CRISPR (ReLiC) screening approach to measure the responses of diverse RNA metabolic events to knockout of 2,092 human genes encoding all known RNA-associated proteins. ReLiC screens highlight modular interactions between gene networks regulating splicing, translation, and decay of mRNAs. When combined with biochemical fractionation of polysomes, ReLiC reveals striking pathway-specific coupling between growth fitness and mRNA translation. Perturbing different components of the translation and proteostasis machineries have distinct effects on ribosome occupancy, while perturbing mRNA transcription leaves ribosome occupancy largely intact. Isoform-selective ReLiC screens capture differential regulation of intron retention and exon skipping by SF3b complex subunits. Chemogenomic screens using ReLiC decipher translational regulators upstream of mRNA decay and uncover a role for the ribosome collision sensor GCN1 during treatment with the anti-leukemic drug homoharringtonine. Our work demonstrates ReLiC as a versatile platform for discovering and dissecting regulatory principles of human RNA metabolism.">

A number of polymorphisms in protein-coding regions that alter drug efficacy or lead to adverse reactions have been characterized; however, noncoding regions that affect drug responses are largely overlooked, except for a limited number of well-studied enhancers. Results We conducted a quantitative assessment of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) based on transcription initiation profiling of mRNAs and noncoding RNAs, including enhancer RNAs, by using CAGE (Cap Analysis of Gene Expression). Candidate CREs identified in a hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell line with stable expression of drug-responsive transcription factor pregnane X receptor (PXR) were further narrowed down by integrating data of PXR-binding sites in human primary hepatocytes and genome-wide association studies. We found more than 100-fold enrichments of the candidates to genetically associated loci with circulating levels of bilirubin and vitamin D, which implicated a link to adverse reactions of PXR ligands. We uncovered novel enhancers of UGT1A1 and TSKU through CRISPR/Cas9 knockout experiments. We identified alleles altering regulatory activities of UGT1A1 and CYP24A1enhancers by using luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, our siRNA experiments revealed an unexpected impact of TSKU on the expression of vitamin D-metabolizing enzymes. Conclusions Our transcriptome-based assessment of CREs expanded the list of drug-inducible and PXR-mediated enhancers and super-enhancers. We identified regulatory alleles that alter drug-induced gene expressions, and discovered a novel molecular cascade associated with an adverse reaction. Our results contribute a precise understanding of the noncoding elements of the human genome underlying drug responses.">

        <tr id="Abstract The use of k-mers to capture genetic variation in bacterial genome-wide association studies (bGWAS) has demonstrated its effectiveness in overcoming the plasticity of bacterial genomes by providing a comprehensive array of genetic variants in a genome set that is not confined to a single reference genome. However, little attempt has been made to interpret k-mers in the context of genome rearrangements, partly due to challenges in the exhaustive and high-throughput identification of genome structure and individual rearrangement events. Here, we present GWarrange, a pre- and post-bGWAS processing methodology that leverages the unique properties of k-mers to facilitate bGWAS for genome rearrangements. Repeat sequences are common instigators of genome rearrangements through intragenomic homologous recombination, and they are commonly found at rearrangement boundaries. Using whole-genome sequences, repeat sequences are replaced by short placeholder sequences, allowing the regions flanking repeats to be incorporated into relatively short k-mers. Then, locations of flanking regions in significant k-mers are mapped back to complete genome sequences to visualise genome rearrangements. Four case studies based on two bacterial species (Bordetella pertussis and Enterococcus faecium) and a simulated genome set are presented to demonstrate the ability to identify phenotype-associated rearrangements. GWarrange is available at https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/GWarrangehttps://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/genome_rearrangement.git.">

        <tr id="Recurrent mutations in serine / arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2), particularly the proline-to-histidine substitution at position 95 (P95H), have been proposed to drive neoplastic diseases. SRSF2 plays pivotal roles in pre-mRNA processing and gene transcription. However, the precise impact of these diverse functions of SRSF2 on cancer cell behaviour remains unclear. Here, we show that deletion or homozygous P95H mutation of SRSF2 both cause extensive DNA damage leading to cell cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo, regardless of cell genotype. We mechanistically demonstrate that SRSF2 is required for efficient bi-directional transcription of DNA replication and repair genes, independent of its function in splicing. In contrast, SRSF2 haploinsufficiency induces DNA damage without halting the cell cycle in cancer cells. Inducing the heterozygous Srsf2 P95H mutation leads to clonal expansion of epidermal cells in mouse skin, but tumor formation is inhibited following exposure to carcinogens. To survive carcinogen treatment, cells containing the Srsf2 P95H mutation undergo substantial transcription rewiring that restores bi-directional gene expression. Thus, our study reveals crucial roles of SRSF2 beyond splicing and underscores its importance in regulating transcription to orchestrate the cell cycle along with the DNA damage response.">

Novel immunotherapies have had extremely limited benefit for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we characterized the immune microenvironment of t(8;21) AML patients to determine how immune cell infiltration status influenced prognosis. Methods Through multi-omics studies of primary and longitudinal t(8;21) AML samples, we characterized the heterogeneous immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment and their immune checkpoint gene expression. Further external cohorts were also included in this research. Results CD8+ T cells were enriched and HAVCR2 and TIGIT were upregulated in the CD34+CD117dim%-High group; these features are known to be associated with immune exhaustion. Data integration analysis of single-cell dynamics revealed that a subset of T cells (cluster_2) (highly expressing GZMB, NKG7, PRF1 and GNLY) evolved and expanded markedly in the drug-resistant stage after relapse. External cohort analysis confirmed that the cluster_2 T-cell signature could be utilized to stratify patients by overall survival outcome. Discussion In conclusion, we discovered a distinct T-cell signature by scRNA-seq that was correlated with disease progression and drug resistance. Our research provides a novel system for classifying patients based on their immune microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Due to the heterogeneity of cancer, precision medicine has been a major challenge for cancer treatment. Determining medication regimens based on patient genotypes has become a research hotspot in cancer genomics. In this study, we aim to identify key biomarkers for targeted therapies based on single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) of genes. The experiment is carried out on 7 cancers on the Encyclopedia of Cancer Cell Lines (CCLE) dataset. Considering the high mutability of driver genes which result in abundant mutated samples, the effect of data sparsity can be eliminated to a large extent. Therefore, we focus on discovering the relationship between driver mutation patterns and three measures of drug response, namely area under the curve (AUC), half maximal effective concentration (EC50), and log2-fold change (LFC). First, multiple statistical methods are applied to assess the significance of difference in drug response between sample groups. Next, for each driver gene, we analyze the extent to which its mutations can affect drug response. Based on the results of multiple hypothesis tests and correlation analyses, our main findings include the validation of several known drug response biomarkers such as BRAF, NRAS, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, and CDKN2A, as well as genes with huge potential to infer drug responses. It is worth emphasizing that we identify a list of genes including SALL4, B2M, BAP1, CCDC6, ERBB4, FOXA1, GRIN2A, and PTPRT, whose impact on drug response spans multiple cancers and should be prioritized as key biomarkers for targeted therapies. Furthermore, based on the statistical p-values and correlation coefficients, we construct gene-drug sensitivity maps for cancer drug recommendation. In this work, we show that driver mutation patterns could be used to tailor therapeutics for precision medicine.">

        <tr id="Technological advancements in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) liquid biopsy have triggered exponential growth in numerous clinical applications. While cfDNA-based liquid biopsy has made significant strides in personalizing cancer treatment, the exploration and translation of epigenetics in liquid biopsy to clinical practice is still nascent. This comprehensive review seeks to provide a broad yet in-depth narrative of the present status of epigenetics in cfDNA liquid biopsy and its associated challenges. It highlights the potential of epigenetics in cfDNA liquid biopsy technologies with the hopes of enhancing its clinical translation. The momentum of cfDNA liquid biopsy technologies in recent years has propelled epigenetics to the forefront of molecular biology. We have only begun to reveal the true potential of epigenetics in both our understanding of disease and leveraging epigenetics in the diagnostic and therapeutic domains. Recent clinical applications of epigenetics-based cfDNA liquid biopsy revolve around DNA methylation in screening and early cancer detection, leading to the development of multi-cancer early detection tests and the capability to pinpoint tissues of origin. The clinical application of epigenetics in cfDNA liquid biopsy in minimal residual disease, monitoring, and surveillance are at their initial stages. A notable advancement in fragmentation patterns analysis has created a new avenue for epigenetic biomarkers. However, the widespread application of cfDNA liquid biopsy has many challenges, including biomarker sensitivity, specificity, logistics including infrastructure and personnel, data processing, handling, results interpretation, accessibility, and cost effectiveness. Exploring and translating epigenetics in cfDNA liquid biopsy technology can transform our understanding and perception of cancer prevention and management. cfDNA liquid biopsy has great potential in precision oncology to revolutionize conventional ways of early cancer detection, monitoring residual disease, treatment response, surveillance, and drug development. Adapting the implementation of liquid biopsy workflow to the local policy worldwide and developing point-of-care testing holds great potential to overcome global cancer disparity and improve cancer outcomes.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND/AIM
There are no established biomarkers for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in colorectal cancer (CRC) with microsatellite stability (MSS) or proficient mismatch repair (pMMR). Therefore, this study aimed to identify biomarkers for ICI benefit in patients with pMMR by analyzing the down-regulated DNA repair-related genes involved in highly immunogenic and immune responses, and comparing their expression levels and clinical features.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mismatch repair (MMR), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and tumor mutation burden (TMB) were evaluated in 13 CRC cases and mRNA expression levels of 95 DNA repair-related genes were measured. DNA repair-related genes with reduced mRNA expression in the high immunogenicity and high immune response groups were identified. Then, the mRNA expression levels of the identified DNA repair-related genes were measured in 135 patients with CRC. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the mRNA expression levels to compare the clinicopathological characteristics of each cluster.


RESULTS
ATR, LIG4, and RAD52 mRNA levels were significantly down-regulated in the high immunogenicity group. GADD45B, SMUG1, and XRCC6 mRNA levels were significantly down-regulated in the high immune response group. Cases in the cluster with reduced mRNA expression of the six genes were pMMR cases. CD8 mRNA expression level was higher in this cluster than in the other clusters.


CONCLUSION
Decreased mRNA expression levels of ATR, LIG4, RAD52, GADD45B, SMUG1, and XRCC6 genes were associated with high cytotoxic T cell and TMB levels, suggesting that these genes could serve as biomarkers for ICI efficacy in pMMR cases.">

We studied 200 children with yo T-ALL from 13 clinical study groups to understand the clinical and genetic features of this disease. We found age and genetic drivers were significantly associated with outcome. yo T-ALL diagnosed in children under three years of age was extremely high-risk and enriched for genetic alterations that result in both LMO2 activation and STAG2 inactivation. Mechanistically, using patient samples and isogenic cell lines, we show that inactivation of STAG2 profoundly perturbs chromatin organization by altering enhancer-promoter looping, resulting in deregulation of gene expression associated with T-cell differentiation. High throughput drug screening identified a vulnerability in DNA repair pathways arising from STAG2 inactivation, which can be targeted by Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition. These data provide a diagnostic framework for classification and risk stratification of pediatric yo T-ALL.">

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), characterized by their length exceeding 200 nucleotides
and lack of protein-coding capacity, are intricately associated with a wide array of cellular
processes, encompassing cell invasion, differentiation, proliferation, migration, apoptosis,
and regeneration. Perturbations in lncRNA expression have been observed in numerous diseases
and have emerged as pivotal players in the pathogenesis of diverse tumor types. Glioblastoma, a
highly malignant primary tumor of the central nervous system (CNS), remains a formidable
challenge even with the advent of novel therapeutic interventions, as primary glioblastomas invariably
exhibit therapy resistance and aggressive behavior. Glioblastomas can arise from progenitor
cells or neuroglial stem cells, revealing profound cellular heterogeneity, notably in the
form of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) possessing stem-like properties. Glioblastomas comprise
neural precursors that harbor essential characteristics of neural stem cells (NSCs). Several
signaling pathways have been implicated in the regulation of self-renewal in both cancer cells
and stem cells. In addition to their involvement in therapy resistance and survival of glioblastoma,
lncRNAs are implicated in the modulation of GSC behaviors through diverse pathways and
the intricate regulation of various genes and proteins. This review aims to comprehensively discuss
the interplay between lncRNAs, their associated pathways, and GSCs, shedding light on
their potential implications in glioblastoma.

Although PLK1 inhibition in experimental models shows potent antitumor effects, translation to the clinic has been hampered by low antitumor activity and tumor relapse. Here, we report the identification of mitochondrial protein signatures that determine sensitivity to approaches targeting PLK1 in human melanoma cell lines. In response to PLK1 inhibition or gene silencing, resistant cells adopt a pro-inflammatory and dedifferentiated phenotype, while sensitive cells engage apoptosis. Mitochondrial DNA depletion and silencing of the ABCD1 transporter sensitize cells to PLK1 inhibition and attenuate the associated pro-inflammatory response. We also found that non-selective inhibitors of the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) exert their anti-proliferative and pro-inflammatory effects via PLK1 inhibition. This work reveals overlooked impacts of PLK1 on phenotype switching and suggests that mitochondrial precision medicine can help improve response to targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant public health challenge, with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance being a major obstacle to effective treatment. Despite advancements, resistance to 5-FU remains formidable due to complex mechanisms such as alterations in drug transport, evasion of apoptosis, dysregulation of cell cycle dynamics, tumor microenvironment (TME) interactions, and extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated resistance pathways. Traditional chemotherapy often results in high toxicity, highlighting the need for alternative approaches with better efficacy and safety. Phytochemicals (PCs) and EVs offer promising CRC therapeutic strategies. PCs, derived from natural sources, often exhibit lower toxicity and can target multiple pathways involved in cancer progression and drug resistance. EVs can facilitate targeted drug delivery, modulate the immune response, and interact with the TME to sensitize cancer cells to treatment. However, the potential of PCs and engineered EVs in overcoming 5-FU resistance and reshaping the immunosuppressive TME in CRC remains underexplored. Addressing this gap is crucial for identifying innovative therapies with enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicities. This review explores the multifaceted mechanisms of 5-FU resistance in CRC and evaluates the synergistic effects of combining PCs with 5-FU to improve treatment efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. Additionally, it investigates engineered EVs in overcoming 5-FU resistance by serving as drug delivery vehicles and modulating the TME. By synthesizing the current knowledge and addressing research gaps, this review enhances the academic understanding of 5-FU resistance in CRC, highlighting the potential of interdisciplinary approaches involving PCs and EVs for revolutionizing CRC therapy. Further research and clinical validation are essential for translating these findings into improved patient outcomes.">

Typical genomic analyses have directed attention toward the most commonly mutated genes. However, assessing the contribution of mutations to cancer phenotypes is crucial. Therefore, we estimated the cancer effects (scaled selection coefficients) for somatic substitutions in T-cell and B-cell cohorts, revealing key insights into mutation contributions. Cancer effects for well-known, frequently mutated genes like NRAS and KRAS in B-ALL were high, which underscores their importance as therapeutic targets. However, less frequently mutated genes IL7R, XBP1, and TOX also demonstrated high cancer effects, suggesting pivotal roles in the development of leukemia when present. In T-ALL, KRAS and NRAS are less frequently mutated than in B-ALL. However, their cancer effects when present are high in both subtypes. Mutations in PIK3R1 and RPL10 were not at high prevalence, yet exhibited some of the highest cancer effects in individual T-cell ALL patients. Even CDKN2A, with a low prevalence and relatively modest cancer effect, is potentially highly relevant for the epistatic effects that its mutated form exerts on other mutations. Prioritizing investigation into these moderately frequent but potentially high-impact targets not only presents novel personalized therapeutic opportunities but also enhances the understanding of disease mechanisms and advances precision therapeutics for pediatric ALL.">

        <tr id="Structural variants (SVs) represent a mechanism by which cancer cells activate oncogenes or disrupt the function of genes with tumor suppressor roles. A recent study by the PCAWG Consortium investigated structural variants in 30 tumor types, identifying focal rearrangements in the oncogenic BRD4 gene in ovarian, endometrial and breast cancers. These rearrangements resulted in decreased BRD4 expression despite increased copy number, suggesting a novel mechanism to finetune gene over-expression. In this study, we show that focal deletions of BRD4 disrupt genomic regulatory regions and impact gene isoform expression in breast and ovarian tumors when compared to their expression across normal tissues. To determine the functional impact of these concomitant amplification and focal deletion events, we first leveraged open-reading-frame (ORF) screen data from 16 cancer cell lines, where we observed that overexpression of BRD4-long and BRD4-short isoforms is toxic for cancer cell growth. We confirmed these results in OVSAHO ovarian cancer cells, where overexpression of both isoforms significantly reduced tumor growth. Next, we mimicked the focal deletions occurring in BRD4 regulatory regions by CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and observed that their depletion functionally ablates tumor cell growth. We finally show that these focal deletions rescue ovarian carcinoma cells from the toxicity effects associated with gene overexpression, suggesting that global BRD4 gene expression levels must be fine tuned to ensure proper cancer cell proliferation. Our study provides experimental evidence for BRD4 deletions constituting the first example of a driver SV alteration reducing toxicity in cancer, therefore expanding the landscape of cancer progression mechanisms.">

OGM detected nearly all clinically relevant cytogenetic abnormalities that SCG identified with >99% sensitivity, provided the clonal burden was above 20%. OGM identified additional cytogenomic aberrations and/or provided information on fusion genes in 77 (48%) patients, including eight patients with normal karyotypes and four with failed karyotyping. The most common additional alterations identified by OGM included chromoanagenesis (n = 23), KMT2A partial tandem duplication (n = 11), rearrangements involving MECOM (n = 7), NUP98 (n = 2), KMT2A (n = 2), JAK2 (n = 2), and other gene fusions in 17 patients, with 10 showing novel fusion gene partners. OGM also pinpointed fusion genes in 17 (11%) patients where chromosomal rearrangements were concurrently detected by OGM and CBA. Overall, 24 (15%) aberrations were identified exclusively by OGM and had the potential to alter AML classification, risk stratification, and/or clinical trial eligibility. OGM emerges as a powerful tool for identifying fusion genes and detecting subtle or cryptic cytogenomic aberrations that may otherwise remain undetectable by CBA.">

Nonetheless, there is a scarcity of studies that comprehensively analyze the correlation between TET family members and the molecular phenotypes and clinical characteristics of different cancers. Leveraging updated public databases and employing several bioinformatics analysis methods, we assessed the expression levels, somatic variations, methylation levels, and prognostic values of TET family genes. Additionally, we explored the association between the expression of TET family genes and pathway activity, tumor microenvironment (TME), stemness score, immune subtype, clinical staging, and drug sensitivity in pan-cancer. Molecular biology and cytology experiments were conducted to validate the potential role of TET3 in tumor progression. Each TET family gene displayed distinct expression patterns across at least ten detected tumors. The frequency of Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) in TET genes was found to be 91.24%, primarily comprising missense mutation types, with the main types of copy number variant (CNV) being heterozygous amplifications and deletions. TET1 gene exhibited high methylation levels, whereas TET2 and TET3 genes displayed hypomethylation in most cancers, which correlated closely with patient prognosis. Pathway activity analysis revealed the involvement of TET family genes in multiple signaling pathways, including cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA damage response, hormone AR, PI3K/AKT, and RTK. Furthermore, the expression levels of TET family genes were shown to impact the clinical staging of tumor patients, modulate the sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs, and thereby influence patient prognosis by participating in the regulation of the tumor microenvironment, cellular stemness potential, and immune subtype. Notably, TET3 was identified to promote cancer progression across various tumors, and its silencing was found to inhibit tumor malignancy and enhance chemotherapy sensitivity. These findings shed light on the role of TET family genes in cancer progression and offer insights for further research on TET3 as a potential therapeutic target for pan-cancer.">

 Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are heterogeneous and highly aggressive hematologic malignancies with dismal outcomes, highlighting the need for novel targeted therapies. PTCLs are characterized by complex tumor-microenvironment (TME) ecosystems with low tumor cell content, admixed with rich immune infiltrates and stromal elements correlated with clinical outcomes. Direct targeting of the TME is an attractive strategy for PTCLs; however, the specific mechanisms that regulate the interdependence between lymphoma and TME remain poorly understood, hampering the development of TME-directed therapies. Our previous work based on driver genetic alterations in PTCL patients and genetic mouse models identified an important role of these driver mutations in remodeling the TME (Cortes et al., 2022). To address the specific role and mechanisms of tumor cell-TME interactions in the pathogenesis of PTCL, we developed a novel experimental platform and cutting-edge computational methodologies using single-nucleus RNAseq analysis to comprehensively profile lymphoma cells and their microenvironment from 27 PTCL patient samples of two major nodal pathologic subtypes, including 18 Nodal T follicular helper cell lymphomas (TFHcL) and 9 PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS). Our approach allowed the identification and in-depth characterization of tumor cells, lymphoid and myeloid TME, and vascular endothelium and non-endothelial stromal cells, which were challenging to capture with conventional single-cell RNAseq. The malignant T-cells in PTCL, NOS were grouped into patient-specific clusters demonstrating significant inter-tumor heterogeneity associated with diverse and frequently complex chromosomal abnormalities identified by copy number variation (CNV) analysis. In contrast, malignant TFHcL cells show a low degree to no apparent chromosomal abnormalities and divide into two major transcriptional subclusters, with tumor cells from the same patient falling into one of the two subclusters. Additionally, genomic profiles of TFHcL tumors revealed that the inter-tumor transcriptional heterogeneity of TFHcL tumor cells was strongly associated with the driver RHOA G17V mutation status. To profile oncogenic pathways critical for PTCL growth, we compared PTCL tumor cells to normal CD4 T-cells from reactive lymphoid tissue. PTCL, NOS and TFHcL tumor cells were equally enriched in the TCR signaling pathway, mitosis, and cell cycle related genes. However, exploitation of KRAS and cytokine-driven inflammatory signals was prevalent in TFHcL but not PTCL, NOS tumor cells. Analysis of the immune TME identified an increase in T regulatory cells, CD8 T-cells, immunoblasts, and macrophages in TFHcL. Furthermore, while dysregulated B-cells with heightened cytokine-driven inflammatory signals were unique to TFHcL, inflammatory macrophages and classic dendritic cells (cDC) were prominent in the TME of both subtypes. Our results uncover shared and subtype-specific pathogenic features in PTCL and pave the way for designing novel precision therapies for PTCL patients.

        <tr id="Introduction: The Euchromatic Histone Methyl Transferase Protein 2 (EHMT2), also known as G9a, deposits transcriptionally repressive chromatin marks that play pivotal roles in the maturation and homeostasis of multiple organs. Recently, we have shown that Ehmt2 inactivation in the mouse pancreas alters growth and immune gene expression networks, antagonizing Kras-mediated pancreatic cancer initiation and promotion. Here, we elucidate the essential role of Ehmt2 in maintaining a transcriptional landscape that protects organs from inflammation. Methods: Comparative RNA-seq studies between normal postnatal and young adult pancreatic tissue from Ehmt2 conditional knockout animals (Ehmt2 fl/fl ) targeted to the exocrine pancreatic epithelial cells (Pdx1-Cre and P48 Cre/+ ), reveal alterations in gene expression networks in the whole organ related to injury-inflammation-repair, suggesting an increased predisposition to damage. Thus, we induced an inflammation repair response in the Ehmt2 fl/fl pancreas and used a data science-based approach to integrate RNA-seq-derived pathways and networks, deconvolution digital cytology, and spatial transcriptomics. We also analyzed the tissue response to damage at the morphological, biochemical, and molecular pathology levels. Results and discussion: The Ehmt2 fl/fl pancreas displays an enhanced injury-inflammation-repair response, offering insights into fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in this process. More importantly, these data show that conditional Ehmt2 inactivation in exocrine cells reprograms the local environment to recruit mesenchymal and immunological cells needed to mount an increased inflammatory response. Mechanistically, this response is an enhanced injury-inflammation-repair reaction with a small contribution of specific Ehmt2-regulated transcripts. Thus, this new knowledge extends the mechanisms underlying the role of the Ehmt2-mediated pathway in suppressing pancreatic cancer initiation and modulating inflammatory pancreatic diseases.">

        <tr id="With age, hematopoietic stem cells can acquire somatic mutations in leukemogenic genes that confer a proliferative advantage in a phenomenon termed “clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential” (CHIP). How these mutations confer a proliferative advantage and result in increased risk for numerous age-related diseases remains poorly understood. We conducted a multiracial meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of CHIP and its subtypes in four cohorts (N=8196) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CHIP and illuminate how these changes influence cardiovascular disease risk. The EWAS findings were functionally validated using human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) models of CHIP. A total of 9615 CpGs were associated with any CHIP, 5990 with DNMT3A CHIP, 5633 with TET2 CHIP, and 6078 with ASXL1 CHIP (P <1×10−7). CpGs associated with CHIP subtypes overlapped moderately, and the genome-wide DNA methylation directions of effect were opposite for TET2 and DNMT3A CHIP, consistent with their opposing effects on global DNA methylation. There was high directional concordance between the CpGs shared from the meta-EWAS and human edited CHIP HSCs. Expression quantitative trait methylation analysis further identified transcriptomic changes associated with CHIP-associated CpGs. Causal inference analyses revealed 261 CHIP-associated CpGs associated with cardiovascular traits and all-cause mortality (FDR adjusted p-value <0.05). Taken together, our study sheds light on the epigenetic changes impacted by CHIP and their associations with age-related disease outcomes. The novel genes and pathways linked to the epigenetic features of CHIP may serve as therapeutic targets for preventing or treating CHIP-mediated diseases.">

        <tr id="Cancer stem cells represent a resilient subset within the tumor microenvironment capable of differentiation, regeneration, and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, often using dormancy as a shield. Their unique properties, including drug resistance and metastatic potential, pose challenges for effective targeting. These cells exploit certain metabolic processes for their maintenance and survival. One of these processes is autophagy, which generally helps in energy homeostasis but when hijacked by CSCs can help maintain their stemness. Thus, it is often referred as an Achilles heel in CSCs, as certain cancers tend to depend on autophagy for survival. Autophagy, while crucial for maintaining stemness in cancer stem cells (CSCs), can also serve as a vulnerability in certain contexts, making it a complex target for therapy. Regulators of autophagy like AMPK (5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) also play a crucial role in maintaining CSCs stemness by helping CSCs in metabolic reprogramming in harsh environments. The purpose of this review is to elucidate the interplay between autophagy and AMPK in CSCs, highlighting the challenges in targeting autophagy and discussing therapeutic strategies to overcome these limitations. This review focuses on previous research on autophagy and its regulators in cancer biology, particularly in CSCs, addresses the remaining unanswered questions, and potential targets for therapy are also brought to attention.">

        <tr id="In recent years, there has been increased focus on exploring the role the non-protein-coding genome plays in Mendelian disorders. One class of particular interest is long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which has recently been implicated in the regulation of diverse molecular processes. However, because lncRNAs do not encode protein, there is uncertainty regarding what constitutes a pathogenic lncRNA variant, and thus annotating such elements is challenging. The Developmental Genome Anatomy Project (DGAP) and similar projects recruit individuals with apparently balanced chromosomal abnormalities (BCAs) that disrupt or dysregulate genes in order to annotate the human genome. We hypothesized that rearrangements disrupting lncRNAs could be the underlying genetic etiology for the phenotypes of a subset of these individuals. Thus, we assessed 279 cases with BCAs and selected 191 cases with simple BCAs (breakpoints at only two genomic locations) for further analysis of lncRNA disruptions. From these, we identified 66 cases in which the chromosomal rearrangements directly disrupt lncRNAs. Strikingly, the lncRNAs MEF2C-AS1 and ENSG00000257522 are each disrupted in two unrelated cases. Furthermore, in 30 cases, no genes of any other class aside from lncRNAs are directly disrupted, consistent with the hypothesis that lncRNA disruptions could underly the phenotypes of these individuals. To showcase the power of this genomic approach for annotating lncRNAs, here we focus on clinical reports and genetic analysis of two individuals with BCAs and additionally highlight six individuals with likely developmental etiologies due to lncRNA disruptions.">

These miRNAs are involved in a wide range of biological processes, encompassing cell division, death, blood cell production, and tumor development. When these miRNAs become dysfunctional, they can promote the invasion and spread of cancer cells in various human malignancies, including leukemia. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the preeminent malignancy affecting children, is a blood cancer marked by the uncontrollable growth of immature lymphoid cells that displace healthy blood precursors in the bone marrow. Despite a decline in ALL mortality rates over the past two decades, a significant proportion of deaths still results from a lack of effective diagnostic and prognostic markers that can guide treatment decisions and overcome drug resistance. The analysis of miRNA expression patterns in ALL could lead to more precise disease classification, earlier diagnosis, and better prognostic outcomes in the near future. The connection between miRNA dysfunction and the biology of ALL suggests that these molecules could represent promising therapeutic targets. Therefore, this review delves into the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in pediatric ALL, exploring how miRNA-based diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies offer unique advantages and hold promise for clinical applications.">

        <tr id="Naïve pluripotent stem cells (nPSC) frequently undergo pathological and not readily reversible loss of DNA methylation marks at imprinted gene loci. This abnormality poses a hurdle for using pluripotent cell lines in biomedical applications and underscores the need to identify the causes of imprint instability in these cells. We show that nPSCs from inbred mouse strains exhibit pronounced strain-specific susceptibility to locus-specific deregulation of imprinting marks during reprogramming to pluripotency and upon culture with MAP kinase inhibitors, a common approach to maintain naïve pluripotency. Analysis of genetically highly diverse nPSCs from the Diversity Outbred (DO) stock confirms that genetic variation is a major determinant of epigenome stability in pluripotent cells. We leverage the variable DNA hypomethylation in DO lines to identify several trans-acting quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that determine epigenome stability at either specific target loci or genome-wide. Candidate factors encoded by two multi-target QTLs on chromosomes 4 and 17 suggest specific transcriptional regulators that contribute to DNA methylation maintenance in nPSCs. We propose that genetic variants represent candidate biomarkers to identify pluripotent cell lines with desirable properties and might serve as entry points for the targeted engineering of nPSCs with stable epigenomes. Highlights Naïve pluripotent stem cells from distinct inbred mouse strains exhibit variable DNA methylation levels at imprinted gene loci. The vulnerability of pluripotent stem cells to loss of genomic imprinting caused by MAP kinase inhibition strongly differs between inbred mouse strains. Genetically diverse pluripotent stem cell lines from Diversity Outbred mouse stock allow the identification of quantitative trait loci controlling DNA methylation stability. Genetic variants may serve as biomarkers to identify naïve pluripotent stem cell lines that are epigenetically stable in specific culture conditions.">

Herein, we present a compendium of matched chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) and transcriptome (scRNA-seq) profiles at single-cell resolution from human breast tumors and healthy mammary tissues processed immediately following surgical resection. We identify the most likely cell-of-origin for luminal breast tumors and basal breast tumors and then introduce a novel methodology that implements linear mixed-effects models to systematically quantify associations between regions of chromatin accessibility (i.e. regulatory elements) and gene expression in malignant cells versus normal mammary epithelial cells. These data unveil regulatory elements with that switch from silencers of gene expression in normal cells to enhancers of gene expression in cancer cells, leading to the upregulation of clinically relevant oncogenes. To translate the utility of this dataset into tractable models, we generated matched scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq profiles for breast cancer cell lines, revealing, for each subtype, a conserved oncogenic gene expression program between in vitro and in vivo cells. Together, this work highlights the importance of non-coding regulatory mechanisms that underlie oncogenic processes and the ability of single-cell multi-omics to define the regulatory logic of BC cells at single-cell resolution.">

        <tr id="Radiotherapy (RT) and immunotherapy (IT) are the powerful tools for cancer treatment which act through the stimulation of immune response, and evidence suggest that combinatorial actions of these therapies may augment each other’s beneficial effect through complex synergistic mechanisms. These molecular strategies are designed to target rapidly dividing cancer cells by either directly or indirectly inducing DNA damage. However, when cells detect DNA damage, they activate a range of signalling pathways known as the DNA damage response (DDR) to repair. Strategies are being developed to interfere with the DDR pathways in cancer cells to ensure their damage-induced degeneration. The stability of a cell’s genetic material is largely dependent on the efficacy of DNA repair and therefore, an in-depth understanding of DNA damages and repair mechanism(s) in cancer cells is important to develop a promising therapeutic strategies for ensuring the efficacy of damage-induced tumor cell death. In recent years, a wide range of small molecule drugs have been developed which are currently being employed to combat the DNA repair deficiencies associated with tumor cells. Sequential or concurrent use of these two modalities significantly enhances the anti-tumor response, however with a concurrent probability of increased incidence of symptomatic adverse effects. With advent of newer IT agents, and administration of higher doses of radiation per fraction, such effects are more difficult to predict owing to the paucity of randomized trial data. It is well established that anti cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), anti- Programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1), anti-Programmed cell death one ligand 1 (PD-L1) can be safely administered with RT and many studies have demonstrated survival benefit with such combination for patients with metastatic malignancy. However, the biology of radioimmunotherapy (RT/IT) is still an open area where research need to be focused to determine optimum dosage specially the interaction of the RT/IT pathways to determine optimum dosing schedule. In the current article we have summarised the possible intracellular immunological events that might be triggered when RT and IT modalities are combined with the DDR antagonists and highlighted present clinical practices, outcome, and toxicity profile of this novel treatment strategy.">

        <tr id="Hypomethylating agents are used as frontline therapy for myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS), but clinical response is unpredictable. To determine whether response was associated with in vivo dynamics of DNA hypomethylation, we conducted a phase 2 trial for MDS using both injection and oral azacitidine (AZA). We established that global DNA methylation levels in peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells were comparable in AZA responders and non-responders during their course of treatment. However, there were distinct baseline and early drug induced differences in CpG methylation in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in responders compared to non-responders that overlapped with regulatory regions of genes associated with tissue patterning, cell migration and myeloid differentiation. Following six cycles of therapy when clinical response typically manifests, differential hypomethylation in responder HSPCs pointed to marrow adaptation as a driver of enhanced haematopoiesis. Taken together, CpG methylation differences in HSPCs may explain variable response to AZA.">

        <tr id="Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) represents a major cellular response to anticancer treatments. Both malignant and non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment undergo TIS and may be harmful for cancer patients since TIS cells develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that can sustain tumor growth. The SASP also modulates anti-tumor immunity, although the immune populations involved and the final results appear to be context-dependent. In addition, senescent cancer cells are able to evade senescence growth arrest and to resume proliferation, likely contributing to relapse. So, research data suggest that TIS induction negatively affects therapy outcomes in cancer patients. In line with this, new interventions aimed at the removal of senescent cells or the reprogramming of their SASP, called senotherapy, have become attractive therapeutic options. To date, the lack of reliable, cost-effective, and easy-to-use TIS biomarkers hinders the application of recent anti-senescence therapeutic approaches in the clinic. Hence, the identification of biomarkers for the detection of TIS tumor cells and TIS non-neoplastic cells is a high priority in cancer research. In this review article, we describe the current knowledge about TIS, outline critical gaps in our knowledge, and address recent advances and novel approaches for the discovery of TIS biomarkers.">

        <tr id="Background: Actionable driver mutations account for 40–50% of NSCLC cases, and their identification clearly affects treatment choices and outcomes. Conversely, non-actionable mutations are genetic alterations that do not currently have established treatment implications. Among co-occurring alterations, the identification of concurrent actionable genomic alterations is a rare event, potentially impacting prognosis and treatment outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence and patterns of concurrent driver genomic alterations in a large series of NSCLCs to investigate their association with clinicopathological characteristics, to assess the prognosis of patients whose tumor harbors concurrent alterations in the genes of interest and to explore their potential therapeutic implications. Results: Co-occurring driver alterations were identified in 26 out of 1520 patients with at least one gene alteration (1.7%). Within these cases, the incidence of concurrent actionable gene alterations was 39% (0.7% of the overall cohort). Among compound actionable gene mutations, EGFR was the most frequently involved gene (70%). The most frequent association was EGFR mutations with ROS1 rearrangement. Front-line targeted treatments were the preferred approach in patients with compound actionable mutations, with dismal median PFS observed (6 months). Conclusions: Advances in genomic profiling technologies are facilitating the identification of concurrent mutations. In patients with concurrent actionable gene alterations, integrated molecular and clinical data should be used to guide treatment decisions, always considering rebiopsy at the moment of disease progression.">

        <tr id="Current treatments for KRAS-mutant colorectal cancers (CRCs) are often limited by cellular plasticity and rewiring responses. Here we describe a promising therapeutic strategy that simultaneously targets epigenetic and oncogenic signals. Specifically, we show that inhibitors of the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, synergize with various RAS pathway inhibitors and promote dramatic tumor regression in vivo. Together these agents cooperatively suppress WNT-driven transcription and drive CRCs into a more differentiated cell state by inducing the Groucho/TLE corepressor, TLE4, along with a network of WNT pathway inhibitors and intestinal differentiation proteins. However, these agents also induce the pro-apoptotic protein BMF, which subsequently kills these more differentiated cells. Accordingly, cell death can be prevented by activating β-catenin, blocking differentiation, or by ablating BMF expression. Collectively, these studies reveal a new therapeutic approach for treating KRAS-mutant CRCs and illustrate a critical convergence of EZH2 and RAS on oncogenic WNT signals, intestinal differentiation, and apoptosis.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Prenatal folate supplementation has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of childhood lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Previous germline genetic studies examining the one carbon (folate) metabolism pathway were limited in sample size, scope, and population diversity, and led to inconclusive results.


METHODS
We evaluated whether ~2,900 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 46 candidate genes involved in the folate metabolism pathway influence the risk of childhood ALL, using genome-wide data from nine case-control-studies in the Childhood Cancer and Leukemia International Consortium (n=9,058 cases including 4,510 children of European ancestry, 3,018 Latinx, and 1,406 Asians, and 92,364 controls). Each study followed a standardized protocol for quality control and imputation of genome-wide data, and summary statistics were meta-analyzed for all children combined and by major ancestry group using METAL software.


RESULTS
None of the selected SNPs reached statistical significance, overall and for major ancestry groups (using adjusted Bonferroni p-value of 5x10-6 and less stringent p-value of 3.5x10-5 accounting for the number of "independent" SNPs). None of the 10 top (non-significant) SNPs and corresponding genes overlapped across ancestry groups.


CONCLUSION
This large meta-analysis of original data does not reveal associations between many common genetic variants in the folate metabolism pathway and childhood ALL in various ancestry groups.


IMPACT
Genetic variants in the folate pathway alone do not appear to substantially influence childhood ALL risk. Other mechanisms such as gene-folate interaction, DNA methylation or maternal genetic effects may explain the observed associations with self-reported prenatal folate intake.">

Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 screening to identify synthetic-lethal dependencies of PPM1D, uncovering superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) as a potential target for PPM1D-mutant cells. We revealed a dysregulated redox landscape characterized by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and a compromised response to oxidative stress in PPM1D-mutant cells.

These modified cells are subsequently reintroduced into the patient, effectively treating blood cancer. CAR-T therapy is approved to be applied in leukemia due to its great clinical therapeutic effect on B cell hematological malignancies. However, solid tumors are more resistant to this therapy for many reasons. The abnormal vascular structure of solid tumors hampers CAR-T cell trafficking. Various kinds of immunosuppressive cells and chemicals in the tumor microenvironment (TME) accelerates CAR-T cell exhaustion, showing poor persistence in vivo. More and more researches have demonstrated that T cell fate is strongly associated with epigenetic regulation. Epigenetic modification is not a direct addition or deletion of DNA, but a reversible method including modifications on DNA and histones, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-mediated regulations. The change of epigenetic landscape in CAR-T cells largely determines the therapeutic performance in vivo. This research outlines three major barriers in CAR-T therapy, including T cell exhaustion, differentiation and infiltration. Additionally, the research elucidates several promising epigenetic reprogramming strategies to reduce CAR-T cells exhaustion, modulate the cell differentiation process, and enhance their infiltration into solid tumors.">

DNA repair is especially understudied in nondividing cells like neurons, which must withstand decades of DNA damage without replicating. This lack of knowledge limits the efficiency and precision of genome editing in clinically relevant cells. To address this, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neurons to examine how postmitotic human neurons repair Cas9-induced DNA damage. We discovered that neurons can take weeks to fully resolve this damage, compared to just days in isogenic iPSCs. Furthermore, Cas9-treated neurons upregulated unexpected DNA repair genes, including factors canonically associated with replication. Manipulating this response with chemical or genetic perturbations allowed us to direct neuronal repair toward desired editing outcomes. By studying DNA repair in postmitotic human cells, we uncovered unforeseen challenges and opportunities for precise therapeutic editing.">

        <tr id="Multidrug resistance (MDR) frequently occurs during cancer therapy and remains a major obstacle for the cure of most cancers(1, 2). Drug resistance could exist intrinsically or be acquired by drug treatment(3–5), yet factors that regulate the resistance remain elusive. Here, we show that most anticancer drugs damage neosynthesized proteins prior to reaching their canonic targets and elicit profound cytotoxicity, which is largely compensated by protein damage response (PDR). We demonstrate that the PDR includes damage recognition and clearance that are mainly mediated by ubiquitin and proteasome systems, although some other factors, including cellular ATP levels and proliferation status, are also involved. We show that cancer stem cells (CSCs), which have lower protein synthesis, and drug resistance acquired cells (DRAC), which have higher proteasome activity, are more resistant than other cells. We further demonstrate that ATP promotes protein synthesis and suppresses proteasome activity, thus, increasing mitochondrial ATP production by PDK1 inhibition and using proteasome inhibitor to block protein damage clearance render CSCs and DRACs more vulnerable to anticancer drugs. Thus, patients with drug-resistant cancers and treatment-naïve patients with low ATP levels and/or high proteasome activity can be identified and subtyped, and therapies containing PDK1-I and/or proteasome-I may be effective options for these patients.">

        <tr id="Uncovering the stimulus-response histories that give rise to cell fates and behaviors is an area of great interest in developmental biology, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. A comprehensive accounting of cell experiences that lead to the development of organs and tissues can help us to understand developmental anomalies that may underly disease. Perhaps more provocatively, such a record can also reveal clues as to how to drive cell collective decision-making processes, which may yield predictable cell-based therapies or facilitate production of tissue substitutes for transplantation or in vitro screening of prospective therapies to mitigate disease. Toward this end, various methods have been applied to molecularly trace developmental trajectories and record interaction histories of cells. Typical methods involve artificial gene circuits based on recombinases that activate a suite of fluorescent reporters or CRISPR-Cas9 genome writing technologies whose nucleic acid-based record keeping serves to chronicle cell-cell interactions or past exposure to stimuli of interests. Exciting expansions of the synthetic biology toolkit with artificial receptors that permit establishment of defined input-to-output linkages of cell decision-making processes opens the door to not only record cell-cell interactions, but to also potentiate directed manipulation of the outcomes of such interactions via regulation of carefully selected transgenes. Here, we combine CRISPR-based strategies to genetically and epigenetically manipulate cells to express components of the synthetic Notch receptor platform, a widely used artificial cell signaling module. Our approach gives rise to the ability to conditionally record interactions between human cells, where the record of engagement depends on expression of a state-specific marker of a subset of cells in a population. Further, such signal-competent interactions can be used to direct differentiation of human embryonic stem cells toward pre-selected fates based on assigned synNotch outputs. We also implemented CRISPR-based manipulation of native gene expression profiles to bias outcomes of cell engagement histories in a targeted manner. Thus, we present a useful strategy that gives rise to both state-specific recording of cell-cell interactions as well as methods to intentionally influence products of such cell-cell exchanges.">

        <tr id="Homologous recombination rearranges genetic information during meiosis to generate new combinations of variants. Recombination also causes new mutations, affects the GC content of the genome and reduces selective interference. Here, we use HiFi long-read sequencing to directly detect crossover and gene conversion events from switches between the two haplotypes along single HiFi-reads from testis tissue of humans, chimpanzees and gorillas as well as human sperm samples. Furthermore, based on DNA methylation calls, we classify the cellular origin of reads to either somatic or germline cells in the testis tissue. We identify 1692 crossovers and 1032 gene conversions in nine samples and investigate their chromosomal distribution. Crossovers are more telomeric and correlate better with recombination maps than gene conversions. We show a strong concordance between a human double-strand break map and the human samples, but not for the other species, supporting different PRDM9-programmed double-strand break loci. We estimate the average gene conversion tract lengths to be similar and very short in all three species (means 40-100 bp, fitted well by a geometric distribution) and that 95-98% of non-crossover events do not involve tracts intersecting with polymorphism and are therefore not detectable. Finally, we detect a GC bias in the gene conversion of both single and multiple SNVs and show that the GC-biased gene conversion affects SNVs flanking crossover events. This implies that gene conversion events associated with crossover events are much longer (estimated above 500 bp) than those associated with non-crossover events. Highly accurate long-read sequencing combined with the classification of reads to specific cell types provides a new, powerful way to make individual, detailed maps of gene conversion and crossovers for any species.">

        <tr id="Ras genes are important oncogenes that are frequently mutated in cancer. Human oncogenic variants exhibit functional distinctions in terms of their representation in different cancer types, impact on cellular targets, and sensitivity to pharmacological treatments. However, how these distinct variants influence and respond to the cellular networks in which they are embedded is poorly understood. To identify novel participants in the complex interplay between Ras genotype and cell interaction networks in vivo, we have developed and tested an experimental framework using a simple vulva development assay in the nematode C. elegans. Using this system, we evaluate a set of Ras oncogenic substitution changes at G12, G13 and Q61. We find that these variants fall into distinct groups based on phenotypic differences, sensitivity to gene dose and inhibition of the downstream kinase MEK, and their response to genetic modulators that influence Ras activity in a non-autonomous manner. Together, our results demonstrate oncogenic C. elegans Ras variants exhibit clear distinctions in how they interface with the vulva development network, and show that extracellular modulators yield variant-restricted effects in vivo.">

        <tr id="Down syndrome is a genetic-based disorder that results from the triplication of chromosome 21, leading to an overexpression of many triplicated genes, including the gene encoding Dual-Specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation-Regulated Kinase 1A (DYRK1A). This protein has been observed to regulate numerous cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell functioning, differentiation, and apoptosis. Consequently, an overexpression of DYRK1A has been reported to result in cognitive impairment, a key phenotype of individuals with Down syndrome. Therefore, downregulating DYRK1A has been explored as a potential therapeutic strategy for Down syndrome, with promising results observed from in vivo mouse models and human clinical trials that administered epigallocatechin gallate. Current DYRK1A inhibitors target the protein function directly, which tends to exhibit low specificity and selectivity, making them unfeasible for clinical or research purposes. On the other hand, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) offer a more selective therapeutic strategy to downregulate DYRK1A expression at the gene transcript level. Advances in ASO research have led to the discovery of numerous chemical modifications that increase ASO potency, specificity, and stability. Recently, several ASOs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to address neuromuscular and neurological conditions, laying the foundation for future ASO therapeutics. The limitations of ASOs, including their high production cost and difficulty delivering to target tissues can be overcome by further advances in ASO design. DYRK1A targeted ASOs could be a viable therapeutic approach to improve the quality of life for individuals with Down syndrome and their families.">

        <tr id="Abstract Radiotherapy is a key treatment option for a wide variety of human tumors, employed either alone or alongside with other therapeutic interventions. Radiotherapy uses high-energy particles to destroy tumor cells, blocking their ability to divide and proliferate. The effectiveness of radiotherapy is due to genetic and epigenetic factors that determine how tumor cells respond to ionizing radiation. These factors contribute to the establishment of resistance to radiotherapy, which increases the risk of poor clinical prognosis of patients. Although the mechanisms by which tumor cells induce radioresistance are unclear, evidence points out several contributing factors including the overexpression of DNA repair systems, increased levels of reactive oxygen species, alterations in the tumor microenvironment, and enrichment of cancer stem cell populations. In this context, dysregulation of microRNAs or miRNAs, critical regulators of gene expression, may influence how tumors respond to radiation. There is increasing evidence that miRNAs may act as sensitizers or enhancers of radioresistance, regulating key processes such as the DNA damage response and the cell death signaling pathway. Furthermore, expression and activity of miRNAs have shown informative value in overcoming radiotherapy and long-term radiotoxicity, revealing their potential as biomarkers. In this review, we will discuss the molecular mechanisms associated with the response to radiotherapy and highlight the central role of miRNAs in regulating the molecular mechanisms responsible for cellular radioresistance. We will also review radio-miRs, radiotherapy-related miRNAs, either as sensitizers or enhancers of radioresistance that hold promise as biomarkers or pharmacological targets to sensitize radioresistant cells.">

        <tr id="While the triggers for the metastatic transformation of breast cancer (BC) cells remain unknown, recent evidence suggests that intrinsic cellular metabolism could be a crucial driver of migratory disposition and chemoresistance. Aiming to decode the molecular mechanisms involved in BC cell metabolic maneuvering, we study how a ketomimetic (ketone body-rich, low glucose) medium affects Doxorubicin (DOX) susceptibility and invasive disposition of BC cells. We quantified glycocalyx sialylation and found an inverse correlation with DOX-induced cytotoxicity and DOX internalization. These measurements were coupled with single-cell metabolic imaging, bulk migration studies, along with transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. Our findings revealed that a ketomimetic medium enhances chemoresistance and invasive disposition of BC cells via two main oncogenic pathways: hypersialylation and lipid synthesis. We propose that the crosstalk between these pathways, juxtaposed at the synthesis of the glycan precursor UDP-GlcNAc, furthers advancement of a metastatic phenotype in BC cells under ketomimetic conditions.">

        <tr id="Despite rapid advances in the field of immunotherapy, including the success of immune checkpoint inhibition in treating multiple cancer types, clinical response in high-grade gliomas (HGGs) has been disappointing. This has been in part attributed to the low tumor mutational burden (TMB) of the majority of HGGs. Hypermutation is a recently characterized glioma signature that occurs in a small subset of cases, which may open an avenue to immunotherapy. The substantially elevated TMB of these tumors most commonly results from alterations in the DNA mismatch repair pathway in the setting of extensive exposure to temozolomide or, less frequently, from inherited cancer predisposition syndromes. In this review, we discuss the genetics and etiology of hypermutation in HGGs, with an emphasis on the resulting genomic signatures, and the state and future directions of immuno-oncology research in these patient populations.">

        <tr id="Introduction. It has been established that the presence of homologous recombination deficiency in a breast tumor is associated with the effectiveness of treatment. But despite the high chemosensitivity of the tumor to DNA-damaging agents, complete pathological responses to treatment are very rare. And this process may be based on a change in the somatic status of BRCA1, that is, a reversion and return of the wild-type allele occurs and the DNA repair function is restored.Aim. To evaluate changes in the presence of chromosomal aberrations and the expression profile of the main genes of homologous recombination in cell models of breast cancer under the influence of cisplatin and docetaxel.Materials and methods. The study was conducted on breast cancer tumor cell cultures: MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. A cell model of drug resistance was obtained for two drugs: cisplatin and docetaxel. RNA and DNA were isolated from cell suspension using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit and QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany), respectively. The expression level of homologous recombination genes was assessed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. To assess the presence of chromosomal aberrations, microarray analysis was performed on DNA chips.Results. Restoration of normal copy number for the BRCA1, CDK12, CHEK1 and RAD51D genes in MCF-7 under the influence of cisplatin was shown. For BRCA2 and PALB2, amplifications were detected. A statistically significant increase in the expression of the BRCA1 (p = 0.04), BRCA2 (p = 0.02), PALB2 (p = 0.01) and RAD51D (p = 0.05) genes was also shown. MDAMB-231 shows that all identified loci with deletions, where the BRCA2, BARD1, CHEK2, PALB2 and RAD54L genes are localized, are restored to normal copy number by cisplatin. The appearance of amplifications was registered for BRCA1, BRIP1, FANCL, RAD51B, PARP1. A similar result was shown for docetaxel. An increase in the expression level is typical for the genes BRCA1 (p = 0.02), BRCA2 (p = 0.02), CHEK2 (p = 0.05), FANCL (p = 0.04), PALB2 (p = 0.05), RAD51C (p = 0.02), PARP1 (p = 0.02), which corresponds to the appearance of amplifications. In the MDA-MB-468 cell culture, an increase in the copy number of only the BRCA1 gene is observed. The effect of docetaxel has no effect on this cell culture. The level of BRCA1 expression increases in direct proportion to the duration of drug action.Conclusion. Thus, the study showed that under the influence of cisplatin, reversion of not only homologous recombination gene mutations, but also other disorders can occur.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy occurring in children. Copy number alterations (CNA) like PAX5, CDKN2A/2B, PAR1 Region, ETV6, IKZF1, BTG1, and RB1 gene deletion are important genetic events that define and prognosticate B-cell ALL. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate associations of CNA with induction phase remission status in childhood B-cell ALL.


METHODS
This study was observational with a cross-sectional design at the Dharmais Cancer Hospital, Harapan Kita Mother and Children Hospital, and Tangerang Regional Public Hospital. We evaluated 74 pediatric B-cell ALL cases with 1-18-year-olds. Genomic DNA was analyzed by Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification Assay (MLPA). This study used the P335 ALL-IKZF1 panel kit, which contains several ALL-related genes. The patient's clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected from medical records from January to December 2019.


RESULT
We observed gene copy number alteration in children with B-Cell ALL. PAX5 was the most commonly observed gene deletion, followed by CDKN21/2B, ETV6, IKZF1, BTG1, RB1, and PAR1 Region. Based on gene mutations, only the PAX5 had a significant association with the remission status of pediatric B-cell ALL (p-value <0.05; OR = 3.91). It showed that patients with PAX5 gene mutations have 3.9 times the risk of no remission and/or relapse compared to those without PAX5 gene mutations.


CONCLUSION
Patients with mutations in the PAX5 gene have a higher chance of not achieving remission and/or experiencing relapse than those without such mutations. The MLPA method can be utilized for examining copy number alterations, which is valuable for achieving more precise stratification in diagnosis.. Further research is needed to expand upon this finding.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Defining the chromosomal and molecular changes associated with myeloid neoplasms (MNs) optimizes clinical care through improved diagnosis, prognosis, treatment planning, and patient monitoring. This review will concisely describe the techniques used to profile MNs clinically today, with descriptions of challenges and emerging approaches that may soon become standard-of-care.


AREAS COVERED
In this review, the authors discuss molecular assessment of MNs using non-sequencing techniques, including conventional cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization, chromosomal genomic microarray testing; as well as DNA- or RNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays; and sequential monitoring via digital PCR or measurable residual disease assays. The authors explain why distinguishing somatic from germline alleles is critical for optimal management. Finally, they introduce emerging technologies, such as long-read, whole exome/genome, and single-cell sequencing, which are reserved for research purposes currently but will become clinical tests soon.


EXPERT OPINION
The authors describe challenges to the adoption of comprehensive genomic tests for those in resource-constrained environments and for inclusion into clinical trials. In the future, all aspects of patient care will likely be influenced by the adaptation of artificial intelligence and mathematical modeling, fueled by rapid advances in telecommunications.">

        <tr id="Emerging immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy have revolutionized cancer treatment and have improved the survival of patients with multiple cancer types. Despite this success many patients are unresponsive to these treatments or relapse following treatment. CRISPR activation and knockout (KO) screens have been used to identify novel single gene targets that can enhance effector T cell function and promote immune cell targeting and eradication of tumors. However, cancer cells often employ multiple genes to promote an immunosuppressive pathway and thus modulating individual genes often has a limited effect. Paralogs are genes that originate from common ancestors and retain similar functions. They often have complex effects on a particular phenotype depending on factors like gene family similarity, each individual gene’s expression and the physiological or pathological context. Some paralogs exhibit synthetic lethal interactions in cancer cell survival; however, a thorough investigation of paralog pairs that could enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy is lacking. Here we introduce a sensitive computational approach that uses sgRNA sets enrichment analysis to identify cancer-intrinsic paralog pairs which have the potential to synergistically enhance T cell-mediated tumor destruction. We have further developed an ensemble learning model that uses an XGBoost classifier and incorporates features such as gene characteristics, sequence and structural similarities, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and gene coevolution data to predict paralog pairs that are likely to enhance immunotherapy efficacy. We experimentally validated the functional significance of these predicted paralog pairs using double knockout (DKO) of identified paralog gene pairs as compared to single gene knockouts (SKOs). These data and analyses collectively provide a sensitive approach to identify previously undetected paralog pairs that can enhance cancer immunotherapy even when individual genes within the pair has a limited effect.">

        <tr id="Transposable elements (TEs) comprise a substantial portion of the mammalian genome, with potential implications for both embryonic development and cancer. This study aimed to characterize the expression profiles of TEs in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), cancer cell lines, tumor tissues, and the tumor microenvironment (TME). We observed similarities in TE expression profiles between cancer cells and ESCs, suggesting potential parallels in regulatory mechanisms. Notably, four TE RNAs (HERVH, LTR7, HERV-Fc1, HERV-Fc2) exhibited significant downregulation across cancer cell lines and tumor tissues compared to ESCs, highlighting potential roles in pluripotency regulation. The strong up-regulation of the latter two TEs (HERV-Fc1, HERV-Fc2) in ESCs has not been previously demonstrated and may be a first indication of their role in the regulation of pluripotency. Conversely, tandemly repeated sequences (MSR1, CER, ALR) showed up-regulation in cancer contexts. Moreover, a difference in TE expression was observed between the TME and the tumor bulk transcriptome, with distinct dysregulated TE profiles. Some TME-specific TEs were absent in normal tissues, predominantly belonging to LTR and L1 retrotransposon families. These findings not only shed light on the regulatory roles of TEs in both embryonic development and cancer but also suggest novel targets for anti-cancer therapy. Understanding the interplay between cancer cells and the TME at the TE level may pave the way for further research into therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a mature T-cell neoplasm associated with marked chemotherapy resistance and continued poor clinical outcomes. Current treatments, i.e. the CD52-antibody alemtuzumab, offer transient responses, with relapses being almost inevitable without consolidating allogeneic transplantation. Recent more detailed concepts of T-PLL's pathobiology fostered the identification of actionable vulnerabilities: (i) altered epigenetics, (ii) defective DNA damage responses, (iii) aberrant cell-cycle regulation, and (iv) deregulated pro-survival pathways, including TCR and JAK/STAT signaling. To further develop related pre-clinical therapeutic concepts, we studied inhibitors of (H)DACs, BCL2, CDK, MDM2, and clas-sical cytostatics, utilizing (a) single-agent and combinatorial compound testing in 20 well-characterized and molecularly-profiled primary T-PLL (validated by additional 42 cases), and (b) 2 independent murine models (syngeneic transplants and patient-derived xenografts). Overall, the most efficient/selective single-agents and combinations (in vitro and in mice) in-cluded Cladribine, Romidepsin ((H)DAC), Venetoclax (BCL2), and/or Idasanutlin (MDM2). Cladribine sensitivity correlated with expression of its target RRM2. T-PLL cells revealed low overall apoptotic priming with heterogeneous dependencies on BCL2 proteins. In additional 38 T-cell leukemia/lymphoma lines, TP53 mutations were associated with resistance towards MDM2 inhibitors. P53 of T-PLL cells, predominantly in wild-type configuration, was amenable to MDM2 inhibition, which increased its MDM2-unbound fraction. This facilitated P53 activa-tion and down-stream signals (including enhanced accessibility of target-gene chromatin re-gions), in particular synergy with insults by Cladribine. Our data emphasize the therapeutic potential of pharmacologic strategies to reinstate P53-mediated apoptotic responses. The identified efficacies and their synergies provide an informative background on compound and patient selection for trial designs in T-PLL.">

        <tr id="The substantial heterogeneity exhibited by head and neck cancer (HNC), encompassing diverse cellular origins, anatomical locations, and etiological contributors, combined with the prevalent late-stage diagnosis, poses significant challenges for clinical management. Genomic sequencing endeavors have revealed extensive alterations in key signaling pathways that regulate cellular proliferation and survival. Initiatives to engineer therapies targeting these dysregulated pathways are underway, with several candidate molecules progressing to clinical evaluation phases, including FDA approval for agents like the EGFR-targeting monoclonal antibody cetuximab for K-RAS wild-type, EGFR-mutant HNSCC treatment. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), owing to their enhanced stability in biological fluids and their important roles in intracellular and intercellular signaling within HNC contexts, are now recognized as potent biomarkers for disease management, catalyzing further refined diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, edging closer to the personalized medicine desideratum. Enhanced comprehension of the genomic and immunological landscapes characteristic of HNC is anticipated to facilitate a more rigorous assessment of targeted therapies benefits and limitations, optimize their clinical deployment, and foster innovative advancements in treatment approaches. This review presents an update on the molecular mechanisms and mutational spectrum of HNC driving the oncogenesis of head and neck malignancies and explores their implications for advancing diagnostic methodologies and precision therapeutics.">

Acquired modifications of energy metabolism in the tumor cells that defy clinical therapy plays pivotal role in frequent and rapid tumor relapse. We investigated the mechanisms of how these cells adopt metabolic rearrangements with therapy pressure. Our earlier findings showed the constitutive availability of retinal degeneration protein 3 (RD3) in human fetal tissues beyond retina, displayed its functional role in tumor pathogenesis, and unearthed its significance in neuroblastoma clinical outcomes. Herein, with the gene surrogate strategy, the whole genome RNA sequencing in reverse engineered (bed-to-bench) patient derived cell lines showed a patient-independent, RD3-dependent stabilization of metabolic programming. Loss of RD3 altered crucial metabolic pathways and coordinated metabolic mayhem in high-risk stage-4 disease. Evaluating the glycolysis phenotype with seahorse revealed that RD3 loss dependent increase in extracellular acidification rate (EACR) associated with glycolysis, glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserves in therapy defying progressive disease. Critically, therapeutic delivery of RD3 (custom archived and characterized RD3 peptide candidates) significantly deregulated glycolysis in such progressive disease that lack RD3, recognizing a RD3-dependent regulation of metabolic activity. Our study outcomes clearly portrayed the thus far unrealized significance of therapy pressure driven RD3 loss mediated metabolism deregulation in neuroblastoma. Crucially, these new findings will pave way for the identification of a novel targeted maintenance therapeutic strategy for treatment of this deadly disease.">

By exploring the current state of the field, we identify and describe the central mechanisms that determine sarcomagenesis. Further, we discuss seminal studies in translational genomics, which enabled epigenetic characterization of fusion-driven sarcomas. Important context for epigenetic mechanisms include, but are not limited to, cell cycle and metabolism, core regulatory circuitry, 3-dimensional chromatin architectural dysregulation, integration with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, and translational animal modeling. Paradoxically, while the genetic requirements for oncogenic transformation are highly specific for the fusion partners, the epigenetic mechanisms we as a community have uncovered are categorically very broad. This dichotomy prompts the question of whether the investigation of rare disease epigenomics should prioritize studying individual cell populations, thereby examining whether the mechanisms of chromatin dysregulation are specific to a particular tumor. We review recent advances focusing on rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, undifferentiated round cell sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, myxoid/round liposarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and desmoplastic round cell tumor. The growing number of groundbreaking discoveries in the field, motivated us to anticipate further exciting advances in the area of mechanistic epigenomics and direct targeting of fusion transcription factors in the years ahead.">

TNBC patients (434 patients from Ruijin cohort) were evaluated with targeted next-generating sequencing for mutations in HRR genes. The frequencies of mutations were compared with public reference cohorts (320 TNBC patients from METABRIC, 105 from TCGA, and 225 from MSKCC 2018). Associations between mutation status and tumor immune infiltration and prognosis were analyzed. HRR genes mutations were seen in 21.89% patients, with BRCA1/2 mutations significantly enriched in tumors with breast/ovarian cancer family history (P = 0.025) and high Ki-67 levels (P = 0.018). HRR genes mutations were not related with recurrence-free survival (RFS) (adjusted P = 0.070) and overall survival (OS) (adjusted P = 0.318) for TNBC patients, regardless of carboplatin treatment (P > 0.05). Moreover, tumor immune infiltration and PD-L1 expression was positively associated with HRR or BRCA1/2 mutation (all P < 0.001). Patients with both HRR mutation and high CD8+ T cell counts had the best RFS and OS, whereas patients with no HRR mutation and low CD8+ T cell counts had the worst outcomes (RFS P < 0.001, OS P = 0.019). High frequency of HRR gene mutations was found in early TNBC, with no prognostic significance. Immune infiltration and PD-L1 expression was positively associated with HRR mutation, and both HRR mutation and high CD8+ T cell infiltration levels were associated with superior disease outcome.">

During subculture expansion, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) senescence diminishes their multi-differentiation capabilities, leading to a loss of therapeutic potential. Up to date, the extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) have been demonstrated to be involved in senescence but the roles of eccDNAs during MSC.Here we explored eccDNA profiles in human bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs). EccDNA and mRNA was purified and sequenced, followed by quantification and functional annotation. Moreover, we mapped our datasets with the downloading enhancer and transcription factor-regulated genes to explore the potential role of eccDNAs.Sequentially, gene annotation analysis revealed that the majority of eccDNA were mapped in the intron regions with limited BM-MSC enhancer overlaps. We discovered that these eccDNA motifs in senescent BMSCs acted as motifs for binding transcription factors (TFs) of senescence-related genes.These findings are highly significant for identifying biomarkers of senescence and therapeutic targets in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for future clinical applications. The potential of eccDNA as a stable therapeutic target for senescence-related disorders warrants further investigation, particularly exploring chemically synthesized eccDNAs as transcription factor regulatory elements to reverse cellular senescence.">

Personalized oncology aims to precisely match patients to treatments with the highest potential of success. Extensive research is done to introduce biomarkers which can predict the effectiveness of a specific targeted therapeutic approach. The EGFR signaling pathway includes several sufficient targets for the treatment of human cancers including NSCLC. Lung adenocarcinoma may harbor both activating and resistance mutations of the EGFR gene, and further, mutations of KRAS and BRAF oncogenes. Less frequent but targetable genetic alterations include ALK, ROS1, RET gene rearrangements, and various alterations of MET proto-oncogene. In addition, the importance of anti-tumor immunity and of tumor microenvironment has become evident recently. Accumulation of mutations generally trigger tumor specific immune defense, but immune protection may be upregulated as an aggressive feature. The blockade of immune checkpoints results in potential reactivation of tumor cell killing and induces significant tumor regression in various tumor types, such as lung carcinoma. Therapeutic responses to anti PD1-PD-L1 treatment may correlate with the expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells. Due to the wide range of diagnostic and predictive features in lung cancer a plenty of tests are required from a single small biopsy or cytology specimen, which is challenged by major issues of sample quantity and quality. Thus, the efficacy of biomarker testing should be warranted by standardized policy and optimal material usage. In this review we aim to discuss major targeted therapy-related biomarkers in NSCLC and testing possibilities comprehensively.">

        <tr id="Targeting tumor metabolism through dietary interventions is an area of growing interest, and may help to improve the significant mortality of aggressive cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here we show that the restriction of methionine in the aggressive KRAS/Lkb1-mutant NSCLC autochthonous mouse model drives decreased tumor progression and increased carboplatin treatment efficacy. Importantly, methionine restriction during early stages of tumorigenesis prevents the lineage switching known to occur in the model, and alters the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) to have fewer tumor-infiltrating neutrophils. Mechanistically, mutations in LKB1 are linked to anti-oxidant production through changes to cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) expression. Human cell lines with rescued LKB1 show increased CBS levels and resistance to carboplatin, which can be partially rescued by methionine restriction. Furthermore, LKB1 rescued cells, but not mutant cells, show less G2- M arrest and apoptosis in high methionine conditions. Knock-down of CBS sensitized both LKB1 mutant and non-mutated lines to carboplatin, again rescuing the carboplatin resistance of the LKB1 rescued lines. Given that immunotherapy is commonly combined with chemotherapy for NSCLC, we next wanted to understand if T cells are impaired by MR. Therefore, we examined the ability of T cells from MR and control tumor bearing mice to proliferate in culture and found that T cells from MR treated mice had no defects in proliferation, even though we continued the MR conditions ex vivo. We also identified that CBS is most highly correlated with smoking, adenocarcinomas with alveolar and bronchiolar features, and adenosquamous cell carcinomas, implicating its roles in oxidative stress response and lineage fate in human tumors. Taken together, we have shown the importance of MR as a dietary intervention to slow tumor growth and improve treatment outcomes for NSCLC.">

The discrete positional distribution and types of RHOA amino acid substitutions vary according to the tumor type, thereby leading to different functional and biological properties, which provide new insight into the molecular pathogenesis and potential targeted therapies for various tumors. However, the similarities and discrepancies in characteristics of RHOA mutations among various histologic subtypes of PTCL have not been fully elucidated. Herein we highlight the inconsistencies and complexities of the type and location of RHOA mutations and demonstrate the contribution of RHOA variants to the pathogenesis of PTCL by combining epigenetic abnormalities and activating multiple downstream pathways.

        <tr id="Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a heterogeneous group of tumors with varying therapeutic response and prognosis, and evidence suggests the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays a pivotal role. Using advanced molecular and spatial biology technologies, we aimed to evaluate the TIME in patients with CRC to determine whether specific alterations in the immune composition correlated with prognosis. We identified primary and metastatic tumor samples from 31 consented patients, which were profiled with whole-exome sequencing and bulk RNA-seq. Immune cell deconvolution followed by gene set enrichment analysis and unsupervised clustering was performed. A subset of tumors underwent in situ analysis of the TIME spatial composition at single-cell resolution through Imaging Mass Mass Cytometry. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed two distinct groups of advanced CRC, one with an immune activated phenotype and the other with a suppressed immune microenvironment. The activated TIME phenotype contained increased Th1 cells, activated dendritic cells, tertiary lymphoid structures, and higher counts of CD8+ T cells whereas the inactive or suppressed TIME contained increased macrophages and a higher M2/M1 ratio. Our findings were further supported by RNA-seq data analysis from the TCGA CRC database, in which unsupervised clustering also identified two separate groups. The immunosuppressed CRC TIME had a lower overall survival probability (HR 1.66, p=0.007). This study supports the pertinent role of the CRC immune microenvironment in tumor progression and patient prognosis. We characterized the immune cell composition to better understand the complexity and vital role that immune activity states of the TIME play in determining patient outcome.">

        <tr id="Intra-tumor heterogeneity is an important driver of tumor evolution and therapy response. Advances in precision cancer treatment will require understanding of mutation clonality and subclonal architecture. Currently the slow computational speed of subclonal reconstruction hinders large cohort studies. To overcome this bottleneck, we developed Clonal structure identification through Pairwise Penalization, or CliPP, which clusters subclonal mutations using a regularized likelihood model. CliPP reliably processed whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data from over 12,000 tumor samples within 24 hours, thus enabling large-scale downstream association analyses between subclonal structures and clinical outcomes. Through a pan-cancer investigation of 7,827 tumors from 32 cancer types, we found that high subclonal mutational load (sML), a measure of latency time in tumor evolution, was significantly associated with better patient outcomes in 16 cancer types with low to moderate tumor mutation burden (TMB). In a cohort of prostate cancer patients participating in an immunotherapy clinical trial, high sML was indicative of favorable response to immune checkpoint blockade. This comprehensive study using CliPP underscores sML as a key feature of cancer. sML may be essential for linking mutation dynamics with immunotherapy response in the large population of non-high TMB cancers.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary The atavistic theory of cancer suggests that cancer development proceeds through cells reverting to ancient survival mechanisms. The Serial Atavism Model (SAM) expands on this, proposing that cancer progresses through multiple stages of reversion to earlier evolutionary forms with cells losing modern traits and regaining primitive ones. One example is the Warburg effect, where cancer cells prefer a type of energy production used by ancient cells before Earth’s atmosphere had oxygen. However, this review argues that cancer metabolism is too complex to be fully explained by this theory. Cancer cells exhibit a wide range of metabolic behaviors that do not fit neatly into a pattern of reverting to an ancient state, indicating that the SAM may not provide a complete understanding of cancer. Abstract The atavistic theory of cancer posits that cancer emerges and progresses through the reversion of cellular phenotypes to more ancestral types with genomic and epigenetic changes deactivating recently evolved genetic modules and activating ancient survival mechanisms. This theory aims at explaining the known cancer hallmarks and the paradox of cancer’s predictable progression despite the randomness of genetic mutations. Lineweaver and colleagues recently proposed the Serial Atavism Model (SAM), an enhanced version of the atavistic theory, which suggests that cancer progression involves multiple atavistic reversions where cells regress through evolutionary stages, losing recently evolved traits first and reactivating primitive ones later. The Warburg effect, where cancer cells upregulate glycolysis and lactate production in the presence of oxygen instead of using oxidative phosphorylation, is one of the key feature of the SAM. It is associated with the metabolism of ancient cells living on Earth before the oxygenation of the atmosphere. This review addresses the question of whether cancer metabolism can be considered as an atavistic reversion. By analyzing several known characteristics of cancer metabolism, we reach the conclusion that this version of the atavistic theory does not provide an adequate conceptual frame for cancer research. Cancer metabolism spans a whole spectrum of metabolic states which cannot be fully explained by a sequential reversion to an ancient state. Moreover, we interrogate the nature of cancer metabolism and discuss its characteristics within the framework of the SAM.">

Efforts are being putto identify promising targets, particularly small non-coding nucleotide sequences, which can lead to new treatments for this disease. The discovery of significant mutations that contribute to the development of colorectal tumors is a major step in the advancement of molecular oncology, as these mutations give rise to heterogeneous tumors that differ in their origin. These mutations play a significant role in the progression of the disease and are now being targeted for treatment. The prognosis for a disease is influenced by the patient's sensitivity to antitumor therapy. However, new approaches to finding effective targets for antitumor treatments face new fundamental challenges due to clinical issues. These issues include the epigenetic regulation of markers of oncogenesis, which allows for the development of new therapeutic strategies. RNA interference, in particular, has been linked to non-copying RNA sequences such as microRNAs. These microRNAs are associated with certain processes that can influence all aspects of oncogenesis. The diversity of microRNAs allows for a differentiated approach when treating tumors in various locations.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive malignancy of hematopoietic stem cells, is characterized by the blockade of cell differentiation, uncontrolled proliferation, and cell expansion that impairs healthy hematopoiesis and results in pancytopenia and susceptibility to infections. Several genetic and chromosomal aberrations play a role in AML and influence patient outcomes. TP53 is a key tumor suppressor gene involved in a variety of cell features, such as cell-cycle regulation, genome stability, proliferation, differentiation, stem-cell homeostasis, apoptosis, metabolism, senescence, and the repair of DNA damage in response to cellular stress. In AML, TP53 alterations occur in 5%–12% of de novo AML cases. These mutations form an important molecular subgroup, and patients with these mutations have the worst prognosis and shortest overall survival among patients with AML, even when treated with aggressive chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant. The frequency of TP53-mutations increases in relapsed and recurrent AML and is associated with chemoresistance. Progress in AML genetics and biology has brought the novel therapies, however, the clinical benefit of these agents for patients whose disease is driven by TP53 mutations remains largely unexplored. This review focuses on the molecular characteristics of TP53-mutated disease; the impact of TP53 on selected hallmarks of leukemia, particularly metabolic rewiring and immune evasion, the clinical importance of TP53 mutations; and the current progress in the development of preclinical and clinical therapeutic strategies to treat TP53-mutated disease.">

        <tr id="G-quadruplex (G4) sequences, which can fold into higher-order G4 structures, are abundant in the human genome and are over-represented in the promoter regions of many genes involved in human cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. They are plausible targets for G4-binding small molecules, which would, in the case of promoter G4s, result in the transcriptional downregulation of these genes. However, structural information is currently available on only a very small number of G4s and their ligand complexes. This limitation, coupled with the currently restricted information on the G4-containing genes involved in most complex human cancers, has led to the development of a phenotypic-led approach to G4 ligand drug discovery. This approach was illustrated by the discovery of several generations of tri- and tetra-substituted naphthalene diimide (ND) ligands that were found to show potent growth inhibition in pancreatic cancer cell lines and are active in in vivo models for this hard-to-treat disease. The cycles of discovery have culminated in a highly potent tetra-substituted ND derivative, QN-302, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial. The major genes whose expression has been down-regulated by QN-302 are presented here: all contain G4 propensity and have been found to be up-regulated in human pancreatic cancer. Some of these genes are also upregulated in other human cancers, supporting the hypothesis that QN-302 is a pan-G4 drug of potential utility beyond pancreatic cancer.">

        <tr id="Transcriptional enhancers can regulate individual or multiple genes through long-range three-dimensional (3D) genome interactions, and these interactions are commonly altered in cancer. Yet, the functional relationship between changes in 3D interactions associated with regulatory regions and differential gene expression appears context-dependent. In this study, we used HiChiP to capture changes in 3D genome interactions between active regulatory regions of endometrial cancer cells in response to estrogen treatment and uncovered significant differential long-range interactions that are strongly enriched for estrogen receptor α (ER) bound sites (ERBS). The ERBS anchoring differential loops with either a gene’s promoter or distal regions were correlated with larger transcriptional responses to estrogen compared to ERBS not involved in differential interactions. To functionally test this observation, CRISPR-based Enhancer-i was used to deactivate specific ERBS, which revealed a wide range of effects on the transcriptional response to estrogen. However, these effects are only subtly and not significantly stronger for ERBS in differential loops. In addition, we observed an enrichment of 3D interactions between the promoters of estrogen up-regulated genes and found that looped promoters can work together cooperatively. Overall, our work suggests that changes in 3D genome structure upon estrogen treatment identify some functionally important regulatory regions; however, these changes aren’t required for a transcriptional response to E2 in endometrial cancer cells.">

        <tr id="Although the study of leukemogenesis has traditionally focused on protein-coding genes, the role of enhancer dysregulation is becoming increasingly recognized. The advent of high-throughput sequencing, together with a better understanding of enhancer biology, has revealed how various genetic and epigenetic lesions produce oncogenic enhancers that drive transformation. These aberrations include translocations that lead to enhancer hijacking, point mutations that modulate enhancer activity, and copy number alterations that modify enhancer dosage. In this review, we describe these mechanisms in the context of leukemia and discuss potential therapeutic avenues to target these regulatory elements. Significance: Large-scale sequencing projects have uncovered recurrent gene mutations in leukemia, but the picture remains incomplete: some patients harbor no such aberrations, whereas others carry only a few that are insufficient to bring about transformation on their own. One of the missing pieces is enhancer dysfunction, which only recently has emerged as a critical driver of leukemogenesis. Knowledge of the various mechanisms of enhancer dysregulation is thus key for a complete understanding of leukemia and its causes, as well as the development of targeted therapies in the era of precision medicine.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in antitumoral and antiviral responses. Yet, cancer cells can alter themselves or the microenvironment through the secretion of cytokines or other factors, hindering NK cell activation and promoting a less cytotoxic phenotype. These resistance mechanisms, often referred to as the “hallmarks of cancer” are significantly influenced by the activation of oncogenes, impacting most, if not all, of the described hallmarks. Along with oncogenes, other types of genes, the tumor suppressor genes are frequently mutated or modified during cancer. Traditionally, these genes have been associated with uncontrollable tumor growth and apoptosis resistance. Recent evidence suggests oncogenic mutations extend beyond modulating cell death/proliferation programs, influencing cancer immunosurveillance. While T cells have been more studied, the results obtained highlight NK cells as emerging key protagonists for enhancing tumor cell elimination by modulating oncogenic activity. A few recent studies highlight the crucial role of oncogenic mutations in NK cell-mediated cancer recognition, impacting angiogenesis, stress ligands, and signaling balance within the tumor microenvironment. This review will critically examine recent discoveries correlating oncogenic mutations to NK cell-mediated cancer immunosurveillance, a relatively underexplored area, particularly in the era dominated by immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cells. Building on these insights, we will explore opportunities to improve NK cell-based immunotherapies, which are increasingly recognized as promising alternatives for treating low-antigenic tumors, offering significant advantages in terms of safety and manufacturing suitability.">

        <tr id="Background/Aim: BRCA1/2 mutations in breast cancer cells impair homologous recombination and promote alternative end joining (Alt-EJ) for DNA-damage repair. DNA polymerase theta, encoded by POLQ, plays a crucial role in Alt-EJ, making it a potential therapeutic target, particularly in BRCA1/2-mutant cancers. Methionine restriction is a promising approach to target cancer cells due to their addiction to this amino acid. The present study investigated the expression of POLQ in BRCA1/2 wild-type and BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cells under methionine restriction. Materials and Methods: POLQ mRNA expression was measured using qRT-PCR in BRCA1/2 wild-type (MDA-MB-231) and BRCA1- mutant (HCC1937 and MDA-MB-436) breast-cancer cells under normal, or serum-restricted, or serum- and methionine-restricted conditions. Results: Compared to BRCA1/2 wild-type cells, BRCA1-mutant cells displayed significantly higher basal POLQ expression in normal medium. Methionine restriction further increased POLQ expression in the BRCA1-mutant cells but decreased it in the BRCA1/2 wild-type cells. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that methionine restriction showed differential effects on POLQ expression, potentially impacting Alt-EJ activity, in BRCA1/2 wild-type and BRCA1-mutant breast-cancer cells. Further investigation is needed to explore the potential of combining methionine restriction with DNA-repair inhibitors, such as PARP inhibitors, to overcome drug resistance in BRCA1/2 mutant cancers.">

        <tr id="Tumor protein p53 (TP53) mediates DNA repair and cell proliferation in growing cells. The TP53 gene is a tumor suppressor that regulates the expression of target genes in response to multiple cellular stress factors. Key target genes are involved in crucial cellular events such as DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, metabolism, and senescence. TP53 genetic variants and the activity of the wild-type p53 protein (WT-p53) have been linked to a wide range of tumorigenesis. Various genetic and epigenetic alterations, including germline and somatic mutations, loss of heterozygosity, and DNA methylation, can alter TP53 activity, potentially resulting in cancer initiation and progression. This study was designed to screen three reported mutations in the DNA-binding domain of the p53 protein in breast cancer, to evaluate the relative susceptibility and risk associated with breast cancer in the local population. Genomic DNA was isolated from 30 breast tumor tissues along with controls. Tetra and Tri ARMS PCR were performed to detect mutations in the TP53 coding region. For SNPs c.637C>T and c.733C>T, all analyzed cases were homozygous for the wild-type allele ‘C,’ while for SNP c.745A>G, all cases were homozygous for the wild-type allele ‘A.’ These results indicate no relevance of these three SNPs to cancer progression in our study cohort. Additionally, the findings from whole exon sequencing will help to predict more precise outcomes and assess the importance of TP53 gene mutations in breast cancer patients.">

Elucidation of the epigenetic underpinnings of these subtypes could provide important insights into the drivers of therapy resistance. In this study, we produced chromatin accessibility maps linked to the binding of lineage-specific transcription factors (TF) by performing ATAC sequencing on 70 mCRPC tissue biopsies integrated with transcriptome and whole genome sequencing. mCRPC had a distinct global chromatin accessibility profile linked to AR function. Analysis of TF occupancy across accessible chromatin revealed 203 TFs associated with mCRPC subtypes. Notably, ZNF263 was identified as a putative prostate cancer TF with a significant impact on gene activity in the double-negative (AR- neuroendocrine-) subtype, potentially activating MYC targets. Overall, this analysis of chromatin accessibility in mCRPC provides valuable insights into epigenetic changes that occur during progression to mCRPC.">

These disorders are marked by atypical brain development, intellectual disabilities, and various associated phenotypic traits. Genetic testing aids in clinical diagnoses, but inconclusive results can prolong confirmation processes. Recent focus on epigenetic dysregulation has led to the discovery of DNA methylation signatures, or episignatures, associated with NDDs, accelerating diagnostic precision. Notably, TRIP12 and USP7, genes involved in the ubiquitination pathway, exhibit specific episignatures. Understanding the roles of these genes within the ubiquitination pathway sheds light on their potential influence on episignature formation. While TRIP12 acts as an E3 ligase, USP7 functions as a deubiquitinase, presenting contrasting roles within ubiquitination. Comparison of phenotypic traits in patients with pathogenic variations in these genes reveals both distinctions and commonalities, offering insights into underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. This review contextualizes the roles of TRIP12 and USP7 within the ubiquitination pathway, their influence on episignature formation, and the potential implications for NDD pathogenesis. Understanding these intricate relationships may unveil novel therapeutic targets and diagnostic strategies for NDDs.">

        <tr id="Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) may have noncanonical functions in transcriptional regulation and metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells, but it is a challenging target. We thus developed small-molecule ligands targeting hTERT promoter G-quadruplex DNA structures (hTERT G4) to downregulate hTERT expression. Ligand 5 showed high affinity toward hTERT G4 (Kd = 1.1 μM) and potent activity against triple-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, IC50 = 1 μM). In cell-based assays, 5 not only exerts markedly inhibitory activity on classical telomere functions including decreased telomerase activity, shortened telomere length, and cellular senescence but also induces DNA damage, acute cellular senescence, and apoptosis. This study reveals that hTERT G4-targeting ligand may cause mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupt iron metabolism and activate ferroptosis in cancer cells. The in vivo antitumor efficacy of 5 was also evaluated in an MDA-MB-231 xenograft mouse model and approximately 78.7% tumor weight reduction was achieved. No observable toxicity against the major organs was observed.">

        <tr id="Strong epigenetic pan-cancer biomarkers are required to meet several current, urgent clinical needs and to further improve the present chemotherapeutic standard. We have concentrated on the investigation of epigenetic alteration of the hTERT gene, which is frequently epigenetically dysregulated in a number of cancers in specific developmental stages. Distinct DNA methylation profiles were identified in our data on early urothelial cancer. An efficient EpihTERT assay could be developed utilizing suitable combinations with sequence-dependent thermodynamic parameters to distinguish between differentially methylated states. We infer from this data set, the epigenetic context, and the related literature that a CpG-rich, 2800 bp region, a prominent CpG island, surrounding the transcription start of the hTERT gene is the crucial epigenetic zone for the development of a potent biomarker. In order to accurately describe this region, we have named it “Acheron” (Ἀχέρων). In Greek mythology, this is the river of woe and misery and the path to the underworld. Exploitation of the DNA methylation profiles focused on this region, e.g., idiolocal normalized Methylation Specific PCR (IDLN-MSP), opens up a wide range of new possibilities for diagnosis, determination of prognosis, follow-up, and detection of residual disease.

        <tr id="The origin of breast cancer (BC) has traditionally been a focus of medical research. It is widely acknowledged that BC originates from immortal mammary stem cells (MaSCs) and that these stem cells participate in two division modes: symmetric cell division (SCD) and asymmetric cell division (ACD). Although both of these modes are key to the process of breast development and their imbalance is closely associated with the onset of BC, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena deserve in-depth exploration. In this review, we first outline the molecular mechanisms governing ACD/SCD and analyze the role of ACD/SCD in various stages of breast development. We describe that the changes in telomerase activity, the role of polar proteins, and the stimulation of ovarian hormones subsequently lead to two distinct consequences: breast development or carcinogenesis. Finally, gene mutations, abnormalities in polar proteins, modulation of signal-transduction pathways, and alterations in the microenvironment disrupt the balance of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) division modes and cause BC. Important regulatory factors such as mammalian Inscuteable (mInsc), Numb, Eya1, PKCα, PKCθ, p53, and IL-6 also play significant roles in regulating pathways of ACD/SCD and may constitute key targets for future research on stem cell division, breast development, and tumor therapy.">

        <tr id="The repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) is crucial for the maintenance of genome stability and cell viability. DSB repair (DSBR) in cells is mediated through several mechanisms: homologous recombination (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), and single strand annealing (SSA). Cellular assays are essential to measure the proficiency and modulation of these pathways in response to various stimuli. Here, we present a suite of extrachromosomal reporter assays that each measure the reconstitution of a nanoluciferase reporter gene by one of the four major DSBR pathways in cells. Upon transient transfection into cells of interest, repair of pathway-specific reporter substrates can be measured in under 24 h by the detection of Nanoluciferase (NanoLuc) luminescence. These robust assays are quantitative, sensitive, titratable, and amenable to a high-throughput screening format. These properties provide broad applications in DNA repair research and drug discovery, complementing the currently available toolkit of cellular DSBR assays.">

        <tr id="To realize the potential of engineered cells in therapeutic applications, transgenes must be expressed within the window of therapeutic efficacy. Differences in copy number and other sources of extrinsic noise generate variance in transgene expression and limit the performance of synthetic gene circuits. In a therapeutic context, supraphysiological expression of transgenes can compromise engineered phenotypes and lead to toxicity. To ensure a narrow range of transgene expression, we design and characterize Compact microRNA-Mediated Attenuator of Noise and Dosage (ComMAND), a single-transcript, microRNA-based incoherent feedforward loop. We experimentally tune the ComMAND output profile, and we model the system to explore additional tuning strategies. By comparing ComMAND to two-gene implementations, we highlight the precise control afforded by the single-transcript architecture, particularly at relatively low copy numbers. We show that ComMAND tightly regulates transgene expression from lentiviruses and precisely controls expression in primary human T cells, primary rat neurons, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, ComMAND effectively sets levels of the clinically relevant transgenes FMRP1 and FXN within a narrow window. Together, ComMAND is a compact tool well-suited to precisely specify expression of therapeutic cargoes.">

        <tr id="Osteosarcoma is a common malignancy that often occurs in children, teenagers and young adults. Although the treatment strategy has improved, the results are still poor for most patients with metastatic or recurrent osteosarcomas. Therefore, it is necessary to identify new and effective prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for diseases. Human genomes contain lncRNAs, transcripts with limited or insufficient capacity to encode proteins. They have been implicated in tumorigenesis, particularly regarding the onset, advancement, resistance to treatment, recurrence and remote dissemination of malignancies. Aberrant lncRNA expression in osteosarcomas has been reported by numerous researchers; lncRNAs have the potential to exhibit either oncogenic or tumor-suppressing behaviors and thus, to govern the advancement of this skeletal cancer. They are suspected to influence osteosarcoma cell growth, replication, invasion, migration, remote dissemination and programmed cell death. Additionally, they have been recognized as clinical markers, and may participate in the development of multidrug resistance. Therefore, the study of lncRNAs in the growth, metastasis, treatment and prognosis of osteosarcoma is very important for the active prevention and treatment of osteosarcoma. Consequently, this work reviews the functions of lncRNAs.">

        <tr id="In recent years, the detection and analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have emerged as a new focus in the field of cancer research, particularly in the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. ctDNA, which refers to cell-free DNA fragments released into the bloodstream from tumor cells upon cell death or shedding, carries tumor-specific genetic and epigenetic alterations, thereby providing a non-invasive approach for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The concentration of ctDNA in the blood is higher compared to that in healthy individuals or other liquid biopsies from early-stage cancers, which is closely associated with the early diagnosis and comprehensive sequencing studies of HCC. Recent studies have indicated that sequential ctDNA analysis in patients receiving primary or adjuvant therapy for HCC can detect treatment resistance and recurrence before visible morphological changes in the tumor, making it a valuable basis for rapid adjustment of treatment strategies. However, this technology is continuously being optimized and improved. Challenges such as enhancing the accuracy of ctDNA sequencing tests, reducing the burden of high-throughput sequencing on a large number of samples, and controlling variables in the assessment of the relationship between ctDNA concentration and tumor burden, need to be addressed. Overall, despite the existing challenges, the examination and analysis of ctDNA have opened up new avenues for early diagnosis and therapeutic efficacy monitoring in hepatocellular carcinoma, expanding the horizons of this field.">

        <tr id="Metabolic reprogramming is recognized as a hallmark of cancer, enabling cancer cells to acquire essential biomolecules for cell growth, often characterized by upregulated glycolysis and/or fatty acid synthesis-related genes. The transcription factor forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) has been implicated in various cancers, contributing significantly to their development, including colorectal cancer (CRC), a major global health concern. Despite FOXM1's established role in cancer, its specific involvement in the Warburg effect and fatty acid biosynthesis in CRC remains unclear. We analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Colonic Adenocarcinoma and Rectal Adenocarcinoma (COADREAD) datasets to to derive the correlation of the expression levels between FOXM1 and multiple genes and the survival prognosis based on FOXM1 expression. Using two human CRC cell lines, HT29 and HCT116, we conducted RNAi or plasmid transfection procedures, followed by a series of assays, including RNA extraction, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, cell metabolic assays, and immunofluorescence analysis. Higher expression levels of FOXM1 correlated with a poorer survival prognosis, and the expression of FOXM1 was positively correlated with glycolysis-related genes SLC2A1 and LDHA, de novo lipogenesis-related genes ACACA and FASN, and MYC. FOXM1 appeared to modulate AKT/mTOR signaling, the expression of c-Myc, proteins related to glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis, as well as extracellular acidification rate in HT29 and HCT116 cells. In summary, FOXM1 plays a regulatory role in glycolysis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and cellular energy consumption, thereby influencing CRC cell growth and patient prognosis.">

        <tr id="Checkpoint inhibitors, specifically anti-PD-1, have shown success in treating metastatic melanoma; however, some patients develop resistance. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in initiating an immune response but in certain circumstances they become ineffective. We investigated the role of MerTK, a receptor tyrosine kinase responsible for myeloid cell clearance of dead cells, in the regulation of DC function and metabolism in the tumor microenvironment. Tumors resistant to anti-PD-1 exhibited increased levels of MerTK+ DCs. Treating wild-type DCs with apoptotic dead melanoma cells in vitro resulted in increased MerTK expression, elevated mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and reduced T-cell stimulatory capacity, all characteristics of dysfunctional DCs. In contrast, dead cells had only limited effect on the metabolism of MerTK-deficient DCs, which instead maintained an antigen presenting, stimulatory phenotype. The efficacy of anti-PD-1 to slow tumor progression and induce specific T-cell infiltration was markedly increased in mice with selective ablation of MerTK in the DC compartment, suggesting the possibility of therapeutically targeting MerTK to modulate DC metabolism and function and enhance anti-PD-1 therapy.">

        <tr id="Persister cells (PS) selected for anticancer therapy have been recognized as a significant contributor to the development of treatment-resistant malignancies. It is found that imposing glutamine restriction induces the generation of PS, which paradoxically bestows heightened resistance to glutamine restriction treatment by activating the integrated stress response and initiating the general control nonderepressible 2-activating transcription factor 4-alanine, serine, cysteine-preferring transporter 2 (GCN2-ATF4-ASCT2) axis. Central to this phenomenon is the stress-induced ATF4 translational reprogramming. Unfortunately, directly targeting ATF4 protein has proven to be a formidable challenge because of its flat surface. Nonetheless, a G-quadruplex structure located within the promoter region of ATF4 (ATF4-G4) is uncovered and resolved, which functions as a transcriptional regulator and can be targeted by small molecules. The investigation identifies the natural compound coptisine (COP) as a potent binder that interacts with and stabilizes ATF4-G4. For the first time, the high-resolution structure of the COP-ATF4-G4 complex is determined. The formation of this stable complex disrupts the interaction between transcription factor AP-2 alpha (TFAP2A) and ATF4-G4, resulting in a substantial reduction in intracellular ATF4 levels and the eventual death of cancer cells. These seminal findings underscore the potential of targeting the ATF4-G4 structure to yield significant therapeutic advantages within the realm of persister cancer cells induced by glutamine-restricted therapy.">

        <tr id="Replication stress (RS) is a key trait of cancer cells, and a potential actionable target in cancer treatment. Accurate methods to measure RS in tumour samples are currently lacking. DNA fibre analysis has been used as a common technique to measure RS in cell lines. Here, we investigated DNA fibre analysis on fresh breast cancer specimens and correlated DNA replication kinetics to known RS markers and genomic alterations. Fresh, treatment-naïve primary breast cancer samples (n = 74) were subjected to ex vivo DNA fibre analysis to measure DNA replication kinetics. Tumour cell proliferation was confirmed by EdU incorporation and cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (CK) staining. The RS markers phospho-S33-RPA and γH2AX and the RS-inducing proto-oncogenes Cyclin E1 and c-Myc were analysed by immunohistochemistry. Copy number variations (CNVs) were assessed from genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. We found that the majority of proliferating (EdU-positive) cells in each sample were CK-positive and therefore considered to be tumour cells. DNA fibre lengths varied largely in most tumour samples. The median DNA fibre length showed a significant inverse correlation with pRPA expression (r = -0.29, p = 0.033) but was not correlated with Cyclin E1 or c-Myc expression and global CNVs in this study. Nuclear Cyclin E1 expression showed a positive correlation with pRPA levels (r = 0.481, p < 0.0001), while cytoplasmic Cyclin E1 expression exhibited an inverse association with pRPA expression (r = -0.353, p = 0.002) and a positive association with global CNVs (r = 0.318, p = 0.016). In conclusion, DNA fibre analysis performed with fresh primary breast cancer samples is feasible. Fibre lengths were associated with pRPA expression. Cyclin E1 expression was associated with pRPA and the percentage of CNVs. © 2024 The Author(s).

We previously found an association between early-life tobacco smoke exposure and frequency of somatic deletions of 8 leukemia driver genes among childhood ALL patients in the California Childhood Leukemia Study. To expand analysis genome-wide and examine potential mechanisms, we conducted tumor whole-genome sequencing in 35 ALL patients, including 18 with high prenatal tobacco exposure and 17 with low exposure as determined by established epigenetic biomarkers. High tobacco exposure patients had significantly more structural variants (P < .001) and deletions (P = .001) genome-wide than low exposure patients. Investigation of off-target RAG recombination revealed that 41% of deletions in the high tobacco exposure patients were putatively RAG-mediated (full RAG motif identified at one or both breakpoints) compared with only 21% in the low exposure group (P = .001). In a multilevel model, deletions in high tobacco exposure patients were 2.44-fold (95% CI:1.13–5.38) more likely to be putatively RAG-mediated than deletions in low exposure patients. No point mutational signatures were associated with prenatal tobacco exposure. Our findings suggest that early-life tobacco smoke exposure may promote leukemogenesis by driving development of somatic deletions in pre-leukemic lymphocytes via off-target RAG recombination.">
