        <tr id="Several therapeutic methods are used to cure acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL (R/R B-ALL) remains the primary cause of death worldwide due to the limitation of cure. Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engaging antibody used to treat R/R B-ALL. The use of blinatumomab for treating R/R B-ALL has shown to be very efficient, especially as a bridge tool to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The response to blinatumomab treatment ranged from 69% after two cycles in phase II clinical trials. Blinatumomab has shown great anti-leukemia activity as a single agent in children with R/R B-ALL. Here, we will review the data from several research groups that show pharmacological and clinical data on blinatumomab for pediatric and adult B-ALL, both as an immunotherapeutic and in combination.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Since the approval of the bispecific antibody blinatumomab in 2017 for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in relapse, the development of numerous bispecific antibody constructs has dramatically expanded in hematologic malignancies. Many have recently received Food Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approvals in various stages of treatment for lymphomas, leukemias, and multiple myeloma.


AREAS COVERED
The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of bispecific antibody treatment including the mechanisms leading to effector T cells targeting tumor-associated antigens, the treatment indications, efficacies, toxicities, and challenges of the different constructs. A literature search was performed through access to PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov.


EXPERT OPINION
While there has been substantial success in the treatment of NHL, MM, and ALL, there are still hematologic malignancies such as AML where there has been limited progress. It is important to continue to investigate new designs, tumor antigen targets, and further refine where current approved bispecific antibodies fit in terms of sequencing of therapy. Hopefully, with the knowledge gained in recent years and the explosion of these therapies, patients with blood cancers will continue to benefit from these treatments for years to come.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVES
To report safety and efficacy of CD19-targeting CAR T cells in a child with refractory juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
We describe the case of a 12-year-old Caucasian boy with severe, chronically active JDM, refractory to multiple immunosuppressive treatment lines, including B-cell depletion with rituximab. The patient received a single infusion of fresh, autologous, second-generation anti-CD19 CAR T-cell product (lentiviral vector) manufactured on the Prodigy device (1x106 CAR T cells/kg), after lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide (1000 mg/m2 over 2 days) and fludarabine (90 mg/m2 over 3 days). Immunosuppressive and glucocorticoid treatment were withdrawn before leukapheresis and CAR T-cell infusion.


RESULTS
Before anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, the patient had persistent severe skin and muscular disease activity. CAR T cells expanded significantly (peak at day 7, 32.69 cells/μL). Complete B-cell depletion was documented on day 5 in blood and at week 2 in bone marrow. The patient presented fever as part of mild cytokine release syndrome (G1), transient anemia (G2) and neutropenia (G4). Neither infection nor neurotoxicity were observed. Laboratory tests, MRI imaging, Physician's Global Assessment of disease activity (PGA), Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) and Cutaneous Assessment Tool for myositis (CAT) were performed at baseline and follow-up to assess treatment response, showing remarkable progressive improvement that persists over time, even after B-cell recovery.


CONCLUSIONS
This JDM patient with severe chronic disease, refractory to multiple treatments, achieved sustained B-cell depletion and ongoing immunosuppressive drug-free clinical and radiological improvement eight months after a single infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells.">

        <tr id="While chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has revolutionized the treatment of B-cell malignancies, many patients relapse and therefore strategies to improve antitumor immunity are needed. We previously designed a novel autologous bispecific CAR targeting CD19 and CD22 (CAR19-22), which was well tolerated and associated with high response rates but relapse was common. Interleukin-15 (IL15) induces proliferation of diverse immune cells and can augment lymphocyte trafficking. Here, we report the results of a phase 1 clinical trial of the first combination of a novel recombinant polymer-conjugated IL15 receptor agonist (NKTR-255), with CAR19-22, in adults with relapsed / refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Eleven patients were enrolled, nine of whom successfully received CAR19-22 followed by NKTR-255. There were no dose limiting toxicities, with transient fever and myelosuppression as the most common possibly related toxicities. We observed favorable efficacy with eight out of nine patients (89%) achieving measurable residual disease negative remission. At 12 months, progression-free survival for NKTR-255 was double that of historical controls (67% vs 38%). We performed correlative analyses to investigate the effects of IL15 receptor agonism. Cytokine profiling showed significant increases in IL15 and the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10. The increase in chemokines was associated with decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts and CD8+ CAR T-cells in blood and ten-fold increases in CSF CAR-T cells, suggesting lymphocyte trafficking to tissue. Combining NKTR-255 with CAR19-22 was safe, feasible and associated with high rates of durable responses (NCT03233854).">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Many older adults with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) have a relapse despite having a measurable residual disease (MRD)-negative complete remission with combination chemotherapy. The addition of blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager molecule that is approved for the treatment of relapsed, refractory, and MRD-positive BCP-ALL, may have efficacy in patients with MRD-negative remission.


METHODS
In a phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients 30 to 70 years of age with BCR::ABL1-negative BCP-ALL (with :: indicating fusion) who had MRD-negative remission (defined as <0.01% leukemic cells in bone marrow as assessed on flow cytometry) after induction and intensification chemotherapy to receive four cycles of blinatumomab in addition to four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy or to receive four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy alone. The primary end point was overall survival, and relapse-free survival was a secondary end point.


RESULTS
The data and safety monitoring committee reviewed the results from the third efficacy interim analysis and recommended that they be reported. Complete remission with or without full count recovery was observed in 395 of 488 enrolled patients (81%). Of the 224 patients with MRD-negative status, 112 were assigned to each group. The characteristics of the patients were balanced between the groups. At a median follow-up of 43 months, an advantage was observed in the blinatumomab group as compared with the chemotherapy-only group with regard to overall survival (at 3 years: 85% vs. 68%; hazard ratio for death, 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23 to 0.73; P = 0.002), and the 3-year relapse-free survival was 80% with blinatumomab and 64% with chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio for relapse or death, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.87). A higher incidence of neuropsychiatric events was reported in the blinatumomab group than in the chemotherapy-only group.


CONCLUSIONS
The addition of blinatumomab to consolidation chemotherapy in adult patients in MRD-negative remission from BCP-ALL significantly improved overall survival. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others; E1910 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02003222.).">

        <tr id="Bispecific T-cell Engagers (TCEs) are promising anti-cancer treatments that bind to both the CD3 receptors on T cells and an antigen on the surface of tumor cells, creating an immune synapse, leading to killing of malignant tumor cells. These novel therapies have unique development challenges, with specific safety risks of cytokine release syndrome. These on-target adverse events fortunately can be mitigated and deconvoluted from efficacy via innovative dosing strategies, making clinical pharmacology key in the development of these therapies. This review assesses dose selection and the role of quantitative clinical pharmacology in the development of the first eight approved TCEs. Model informed drug development (MIDD) strategies can be used at every stage to guide TCE development. Mechanistic modeling approaches allow for (1) efficacious yet safe first-in-human dose selection as compared with in vitro minimum anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) approach; (2) rapid escalation and reducing number of patients with subtherapeutic doses through model-based adaptive design; (3) virtual testing of different step-up dosing regimens that may not be feasible to be evaluated in the clinic; and (4) selection and justification of the optimal clinical step-up and full treatment doses. As the knowledge base around TCEs continues to grow, the relevance and utilization of MIDD strategies for supporting the development and dose optimization of these molecules are expected to advance, optimizing the benefit-risk profile for cancer patients.">

        <tr id="CAR-T cell (Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cell) therapy has revolutionized the treatment of various hematologic malignances. CD19 targeted CAR-T cell therapy is coming in a big way in rheumatic diseases. Recent case reports and case series have shown encouraging results in diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis and antisynthetase syndrome which have been refractory to multiple existing therapies. The dramatic response encompasses objective improvement across multiple clinical domains as well as seroconversion. Side effects of concern with CAR-T cell therapy are related to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). The reported side effects of this therapy for autoimmune diseases were of low grade and were managed without any fatality. Several modifications in CAR-T cell therapy have been proposed to maximize the safety and improving the efficacy. This therapy has got the potential to be a major breakthrough in management of rheumatic diseases, especially wherein existing therapies have been refractory.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells have revolutionized cancer treatment, showing significant success, including treatment of pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic (B-ALL) leukemia. Despite their efficacy, Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) emerges as a common early adverse effect that can be life threatening in severe cases, resulting from the immune system's targeted activation against tumors.


AREAS COVERED
This review concentrates on CRS in children and young adults undergoing CAR T-cell therapy for B-ALL. It explores CRS pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and incidence, emphasizing the importance of a consensus definition and grading to homogenize the treatment according to the severity of symptoms. We will discuss the standard of care treatment of CRS but also novel approaches. We will highlight the importance of managing CRS without compromising the efficacy of immune cell activation against tumors.


EXPERT OPINION
As CAR T-cell therapy in pediatric B-ALL become increasingly available and used, optimal management of cytokine release syndrome becomes increasingly important. Early recognition and timely management has improved. Further information will aid us to identify optimal timing of tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Continued bench research coupled with clinical studies and biomarker discovery will allow for valuable insights into CRS pathophysiology and patient-and/or cell-targeted treatments.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management lean toward achieving remission or low-disease activity. In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 36 individuals (18 RA patients and 18 matched controls, accounting for age, sex, race, and ethnicity), to identify disease-relevant cell subsets and cell type-specific signatures associated with disease activity. Our analysis revealed 18 distinct PBMC subsets, including an IFITM3 overexpressing Interferon-activated (IFN-activated) monocyte subset. We observed an increase in CD4+ T effector memory cells in patients with moderate to high disease activity (DAS28-CRP ≥ 3.2), and a decrease in non-classical monocytes in patients with low disease activity or remission (DAS28-CRP < 3.2). Pseudobulk analysis by cell type identified 168 differentially expressed genes between RA and matched controls, with a downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes in the gamma-delta T cells subset, alteration of genes associated with RA predisposition in the IFN-activated subset, and non-classical monocytes. Additionally, we identified a gene signature associated with moderate-high disease activity, characterized by upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes such as TNF, JUN, EGR1, IFIT2, MAFB, G0S2, and downregulation of genes including HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB5, TNFSF13B. Notably, cell-cell communication analysis revealed an upregulation of signaling pathways, including VISTA, in both moderate-high and remission-low disease activity contexts. Our findings provide valuable insights into the systemic cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying RA disease activity.">

        <tr id="RATIONALE
Patients with relapsed and refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) with the T315I mutation are at higher risk of relapse and have shorter overall survival.


PATIENT CONCERNS
A 31-year-old man presented to the hematology department with intermittent fever and pancytopenia. He was diagnosed with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia and experienced 2 relapses during treatment. A drug-resistant T315I mutation was detected in the ABL kinase region during review.


DIAGNOSES
Morphological examination of the bone marrow revealed approximately 93.5% lymphoid blast. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed the diagnosis of common B-cell ALL with the following phenotype: CD34, CD45dim, CD19, CD10, cCD79a, CD58dim, CD81dim, cTdT, HLA-DR, CD22dim, CXCR4, CD33dim, CD20, CD25, CD13, CD123. The examination of the ABL kinase region mutation suggested a T315I mutation.


INTERVENTIONS
Olverembatinib, a third-generation TKI drug, was administered in combination with inotuzumab ozogamicin to treat the disease.


OUTCOMES
The patient achieved morphological remission with a negative flow cytometry MRD test, and the quantification of BCR-ABL transcripts was 0% after 1 cycle of therapy.


LESSONS
The third-generation TKI olverembatinib has been proven to be effective in CML patients with the T315I mutation, and it may also be effective in Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Some new immune drugs have also shown improvement in the remission rate. Combination therapy with olverembatinib and Ino can achieve a complete molecular response in patients with relapsed and refractory Ph+ ALL with the T315I mutation.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive autoimmune disease that mainly affects the inner lining of the synovial joints and leads to chronic inflammation. While RA is not known as lethal, recent research indicates that it may be a silent killer because of its strong association with an increased risk of chronic lung and heart diseases. Patients develop these systemic consequences due to the regular uptake of heavy drugs such as disease-modifying antirheumatic medications (DMARDs), glucocorticoids (GCs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), etc. Nevertheless, a number of these medications have off-target effects, which might cause adverse toxicity, and have started to become resistant in patients as well. Therefore, alternative and promising therapeutic techniques must be explored and adopted, such as post-translational modification inhibitors (like protein arginine deiminase inhibitors), RNA interference by siRNA, epigenetic drugs, peptide therapy, etc., specifically in macrophages, neutrophils, Treg cells and dendritic cells (DCs). As the target cells are specific, ensuring targeted delivery is also equally important, which can be achieved with the advent of nanotechnology. Furthermore, these nanocarriers have fewer off-site side effects, enable drug combinations, and allow for lower drug dosages. Among the nanoparticles that can be used for targeting, there are both inorganic and organic nanomaterials such as solid-lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, hydrogels, dendrimers, and biomimetics that have been discussed. This review highlights contemporary therapy options targeting macrophages, neutrophils, Treg cells, and DCs and explores the application of diverse nanotechnological techniques to enhance precision RA therapies.">

        <tr id="For the monitoring of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, antigen-based CAR detection methods are usually applied. However, for each target-antigen, a separate detection system is required. Furthermore, when monitored CAR T-cells in the blood of patients treated with bispecific antibodies or T-cell engagers (bsAbs/BiTEs) recognize the same antigen, these methods produce false-positive results in clinical diagnostics. Anti-CAR-linker monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the linker sequence between the variable domains of the antigen binding CAR fragment promise a universal and unbiased CAR detection. To test this, we analyzed clinical specimens of all BCMA- and CD19-targeting CAR T-cell products currently approved for clinical use. We found a highly specific and sensitive CAR detection using anti-CAR-linker mAb in blood cells from patients treated with Ide-cel, Tisa-cel, Axi-cel, Brexu-cel, and Liso-cel. For Ide-cel and Tisa-cel, the sensitivity was significantly lower compared to that for antigen-based CAR detection assays. Strikingly, the specificity of anti-CAR linker mAb was not affected by the simultaneous presence of bispecific blinatumomab or teclistamab for Axi-cel, Brexu-cel, Liso-cel, or Ide-cel, respectively. Cilta-cel (containing a monomeric G4S-CAR linker) could not be detected by anti-CAR linker mAb. In conclusion, anti-CAR-linker mAbs are highly specific and useful for CAR T-cell monitoring but are not universally applicable.">

Given the poor outcomes for patients experiencing a post-infusion relapse, particularly those with loss of the target antigen, a strategic approach to diagnosis and treatment is imperative. In this discussion, we outline a systematic approach to managing post-immunotherapy events, categorized by CD19-positive relapse, CD19-negative relapse, and LS. We explore treatment modalities including CD19-CAR re-infusions, humanized CAR constructs, combinatorial strategies, and alternative antigen-targeted therapies, such as blinatumomab and inotuzumab. Challenges in diagnosis, particularly with antigen-escape, are addressed, highlighting the role of next-generation sequencing and multiparameter flow cytometry for myeloid marker monitoring.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) could participate in the regulation of diverse cells via interacting with non-G-protein-coupled receptors. In the present work, we explored how paroxetine, a GRK2 inhibitor, modulates the differentiation and activation of immune cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).


METHODS
The blood samples of healthy individuals and RA patients were collected between July 2021 and March 2022 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. C57BL/6 mice were used to induce the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. Flow cytometry analysis was used to characterize the differentiation and function of dendritic cells (DCs)/T cells. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to explore the specific molecular mechanism.


RESULTS
In patients with RA, high expression of GRK2 in peripheral blood lymphocytes, accompanied by the increases of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In animal model, a decrease in regulatory T cells (Tregs), an increase in the cluster of differentiation 8 positive (CD8+) T cells, and maturation of DCs were observed. Paroxetine, when used in vitro and in CIA mice, restrained the maturation of DCs and the differentiation of CD8+ T cells, and induced the proportion of Tregs. Paroxetine inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the expression of C-C motif chemokine receptor 7 in DCs and T cells. Simultaneously, paroxetine upregulated the expression of programmed death ligand 1, and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, paroxetine inhibited the PI3K-AKT-mTOR metabolic pathway in both DCs and T cells. This was associated with a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and changes in the utilization of glucose and lipids, particularly in DCs. Paroxetine reversed PI3K-AKT pathway activation induced by 740 Y-P (a PI3K agonist) through inhibiting the interaction between GRK2 and PI3K in DCs and T cells.


CONCLUSION
Paroxetine exerts an immunosuppressive effect by targeting GRK2, which subsequently inhibits the metabolism-related PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway of DCs and T cell in RA.">

        <tr id="Introduction and Objectives: In healthy individuals, activation and expansion of CD8 regulatory T cells (CD8 Treg) leads to selective killing of pathogenic CD4 T cells without broad immunosuppression. In patients with autoimmunity, CD8 Treg appear dysfunctional, allowing pathogenic CD4 T cell expansion and downstream inflammatory events, causing damage to healthy tissues. MTX-101 is a bispecific CD8 Treg modulator targeting CD8 and KIR2DL(1/2/3), co-expressed on CD8 Treg. MTX-101 targets CD8 Treg to restore their function and reduce inflammation without unwanted immune cell activation or global immune suppression. By targeting a root cause of CD4-driven autoimmune diseases, our data suggest that MTX-101 is a promising CD8 Treg-specific therapeutic to restore immune balance for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).
 Methods: We evaluated MTX-101 binding, mechanism of action, and specificity in vitro using human PBMCs and in vivo using a human CD4 T cell-driven GVHD model. Pharmacology and early tolerability were evaluated in humanized CD34+-engrafted NSG(IL-15Tg) mice.
 Results: MTX-101 increased the activation and functions of CD8 Treg without activating other immune cells or affecting global immune responses in vitro, and improved outcomes in the acute GVHD model. In Balb/c and humanized mice, MTX-101 pharmacokinetics were consistent with antibody-like molecules. In humanized mice, MTX-101 bound CD8 Treg in peripheral blood and terminal tissues, with no resulting activation of immune cells. No induction of proinflammatory serum cytokines were observed following MTX-101 dosing at concentrations up to 50 mg/kg.
 Conclusion: MTX-101 restores CD8 Treg functions and may provide durable resistance to autoimmune disease progression.

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Teclistamab, a bispecific T-cell engaging antibody targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), is indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after at least four lines of therapy. It has boxed warnings for life threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). To mitigate these risks, teclistamab is initiated using step-up doses. This article examines safety event rates following the implementation of a 2-day separation between step-up doses at one institution to streamline patient care.


METHODS
This was a retrospective, single-center study encompassing all patients who received teclistamab within a 1-year period. The primary endpoint was the overall incidence of CRS and ICANS. Secondary endpoints included hospital length of stay, hematological toxicities, infection rates, among other adverse events.


RESULTS
A total of 27 patients were included in the analysis and stratified into accelerated (days 1,3,5) or standard (days 1,4,7) dosing groups. CRS occurred in 48% (11) of patients for the accelerated dosing and 50% (2) for the standard dosing group. ICANS was seen in 17% (4) of patients in the accelerated dosing group and none in the standard dosing group. Average length of stay in the accelerated dose was 7.6 days versus 9.2 days in the standard dose group.


CONCLUSION
Accelerated dose escalation of teclistamab yielded safety event rates comparable to those in the literature. These findings may support outpatient administration for teclistamab. Accelerated dose escalation strategy allowed for the optimization of hospitalization and resources.">

        <tr id="Despite the use of 'high efficacy' disease-modifying therapies, disease activity and clinical progression of different immune-mediated neurological diseases continue for some patients, resulting in accumulating disability, deteriorating social and mental health, and high economic cost to patients and society. Although autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant is an effective treatment modality, it is an intensive chemotherapy-based therapy with a range of short- and long-term side-effects. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) has revolutionized the treatment of B-cell and other hematological malignancies, conferring long-term remission for otherwise refractory diseases. However, the toxicity of this treatment, particularly cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, and the complexity of production necessitate the need for a high level of specialization at treating centers. Early-phase trials of CAR-T therapies in immune-mediated B cell driven conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and myasthenia gravis, have shown dramatic clinical response with few adverse events. Based on the common physiopathology, CAR-T therapy in other immune-mediated neurological disease, including multiple sclerosis, chronic inflammatory polyradiculopathy, autoimmune encephalitis, and stiff person syndrome, might be an effective option for patients, avoiding the need for long-term immunosuppressant medications. It may prove to be a more selective immunoablative approach than autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, with potentially increased efficacy and lower adverse events. In this review, we present the state of the art and future directions of the use of CAR-T in such conditions. ANN NEUROL 2024.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Antibiotic-Refractory Lyme Arthritis (ARLA) involves a complex interplay of T cell responses targeting Borrelia burgdorferi antigens succeeding towards autoantigens by epitope spreading. However, the precise molecular mechanisms driving the pathogenic T cell response in ARLA remain unclear. Our aim was to elucidate the molecular program of disease-specific Th cells.


METHODS
Using flow cytometry, high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and scRNA-seq of CD4+ Th cells isolated from the joints of European ARLA patients, we aimed at inferring antigen specificity through unbiased analysis of TCR repertoire patterns, identifying surrogate markers for disease-specific TCRs and connecting TCR specificity to transcriptional patterns.


RESULTS
PD-1hiHLA-DR+CD4+ effector T cells were clonally expanded within the inflamed joints and persisted throughout disease course. Among these cells, we identified a distinct TCRβ motif restricted to HLA-DRB1*11 or *13 alleles. These alleles, being underrepresented in North American ARLA patients, were unexpectedly prevalent in our European cohort. The identified TCRβ motif served as surrogate marker for a convergent TCR response specific to ARLA, distinguishing it from other rheumatic diseases. In the scRNA-seq dataset, the TCRβ motif particularly mapped to peripheral T helper (TPH) cells displaying signs of sustained proliferation, continuous TCR signaling, and expressing CXCL13 and IFN-γ.


CONCLUSION
By inferring disease-specific TCRs from synovial T cells we identified a convergent TCR response in the joints of ARLA patients that continuously fueled the expansion of TPH cells expressing a pathogenic cytokine effector program. The identified TCRs will aid in uncovering the major antigen targets of the maladaptive immune response.

        <tr id="Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an orphan neurodegenerative disease. Immune system dysregulation plays an essential role in ALS onset and progression. Our preclinical studies have shown that the administration of exogenous allogeneic B cells improves outcomes in murine models of skin and brain injury through a process termed pligodraxis, in which B cells adopt an immunoregulatory and neuroprotective phenotype in an injured environment. Here, we investigated the effects of B-cell therapy in the SOD1G93A mouse preclinical model of ALS and in a person living with ALS. Purified splenic mature naïve B cells from haploidentical donor mice were administered intravenously in SOD1G93A mice for a total of 10 weekly doses. For the clinical study in a person with advanced ALS, IgA gammopathy of unclear significance, and B lymphopenia, CD19+ B cells were positively selected from a healthy haploidentical donor and infused intravenously twice, at a 60-day interval. Repeated intravenous B-cell administration was safe and significantly delayed disease onset, extended survival, reduced cellular apoptosis, and decreased astrogliosis in SOD1G93A mice. Repeated B-cell infusion in a person with ALS was safe and did not appear to generate a clinically evident inflammatory response. An improvement of 5 points on the ALSFRS-R scale was observed after the first infusion. Levels of inflammatory markers showed persistent reduction post-infusion. This represents a first demonstration of the efficacy of haploidentical B-cell infusion in the SOD1G93A mouse and the safety and feasibility of using purified haploidentical B lymphocytes as a cell-based therapeutic strategy for a person with ALS.">

        <tr id="Clinical trials of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy have demonstrated remarkable success in treating both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Nanobodies (Nbs) have emerged as promising antigen-targeting domains for CARs, owing to their high specificity, robust stability, and strong affinity, leading to significant advancements in the field of Nb-CAR-T. In the realm of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) targets, CD5 stands out as a potentially excellent candidate for T-cell-based CAR therapy, due to its distinct expression on the surface of malignant T-ALL cells. To mitigate graft-versus-host disease associated with allogeneic CAR-T, γδT cells are selected and stimulated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and γδT cells are engineered via CRISPR/Cas9 to eliminate fratricide, enabling the creation of fratricide-resistant CAR-γδTCD5- cells. In vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA is used to construct CAR-T, presenting a safer, faster, and cost-effective method compared to traditional viral vector approaches. In this study, a CD5-VHH library is constructed, and specific CD5-nanobodies are screened for subsequent use in CD5-CAR-γδTCD5- therapy. IVT-mRNA-CD5-CAR-γδTCD5- cells exhibited favorable functional characteristics and demonstrated antitumor efficacy against malignant T cell lines, underlining the potential for advancing mRNA-CD5-CAR-γδTCD5- therapy.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) provide a new mode of targeting multiple myeloma (MM) plasma cells (PCs), basing their action on the activation and redirection of the T-cell compartment against neoplastic cells. Two BCMA-targeting (teclistamab and elranatamab) plus one GPRC5D-targeting (talquetamab) BsAbs are available for the management of heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory (RR) MM. Novel strategies to augment potency, reduce toxicity, and improve management are under investigation. This review summarizes the clinical applications of BsAbs and discusses the current challenges of the treatment and opportunities for optimization. Abstract Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are artificially engineered antibodies that can bind simultaneously to the CD3 subunit within the T-cell receptor complex and an antigen on tumor cells, leading to T-cell activation and tumor cell killing. BsAbs against BCMA or GPRC5D have shown impressive clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), with some agents having already received regulatory approval after the third (by the European Medicines Agency, EMA) or fourth (by the Food and Drug Administration, FDA) line of therapy; the results of early-phase clinical trials targeting FcRH5 are also promising. Overall, BsAbs as monotherapy correlated with an ORR that exceeded 60%, with a high CR rate ranging between 25% and 50% and a median PFS of around 1 year among patients with a median of 4–6 prior lines of therapy. The main toxicities include cytokine release syndrome, cytopenias, hypogammaglobulinemia, and infections; on-target off-tumor adverse events involving the skin, mucosa, hair, and nails may also occur with anti-GPRC5D BsAbs. Active research to increase their efficacy and improve their tolerance is still in progress, including combination therapies and application in earlier treatment lines and the development of novel agents. A better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance is a challenge and could lead to more personalized approaches.">

        <tr id="Abstract Recently, bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are evolving the landscape of cancer treatment and have significantly improved the outcomes of relapsed or refractory cancer patients. As increasing BsAbs entered clinical practice, specific toxicities have emerged, and renal side-effects have been described. However, there are a lack of studies analyzing the nephrotoxicity in the anti-cancer BsAbs recipients systematically. In this review, we demonstrate the etiologies, mechanisms, other risk factors and treatment options of kidney injury in the BsAbs recipients to provide a more comprehensive insight into the nephrotoxicity post-BsAbs therapy. Significantly, due to the limited clinical trial data on each subject, we mainly conclude the related etiologies, mechanisms, and risk factors of nephrotoxicity that occur in T-cell-engaging BsAbs recipients. Nephrotoxicity associated with non-T-cell BsAbs may be associated with adverse nephrotoxicity of related monoclonal antibodies to two specific antigens. The aim of this paper is to provide nephrologists and oncologists with theoretical knowledge to provide better medical management for recipients who receive BsAbs, especially T-cell-engaging BsAbs treatment.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Interleukin-6 receptor antibodies (IL-6R Abs), including satralizumab, are increasingly used to prevent relapse for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). However, the detailed mechanism of action of this treatment on the lymphocyte phenotype remains unclear. This study focused on B cells in patients with NMOSD, hypothesizing that IL-6R Ab enables B cells to acquire regulatory functions by producing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated in vitro to induce the expansion of B-cell subsets, double-negative B cells (DNs; CD19+ IgD−, CD27−) and plasmablasts (PBs; CD19+, CD27hi, CD38hi). Whole B cells, DNs, or PBs were isolated after culture with IL-6R Ab, and IL-10 expression was quantified using quantitative PCR and a cytometric bead array. RNA sequencing was performed to identify the marker of regulatory PBs induced by IL-6R Ab. Results DNs and PBs were observed to expand in patients with NMSOD during the acute attacks. In the in vitro model, IL-6R Ab increased IL-10 expression in B cells. Notably, IL-10 expression increased in PBs but not in DNs. Using RNA sequencing, CD200 was identified as a marker of regulatory PBs among the differentially expressed upregulated genes. CD200+ PBs produced more IL-10 than CD200− PBs. Furthermore, patients with NMOSD who received satralizumab had a higher proportion of CD200+ PBs than patients during the acute attacks. Discussion Treatment with IL-6 signaling blockade elicited a regulatory phenotype in B cells and PBs. CD200+ PBs may be a marker of treatment responsiveness in the context of NMOSD pathophysiology.">

        <tr id="Most patients treated with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells eventually experience disease progression. Furthermore, CAR T cells have not been curative against solid cancers and several hematological malignancies such as T cell lymphomas, which have very poor prognoses. One of the main barriers to the clinical success of adoptive T cell immunotherapies is CAR T cell dysfunction and lack of expansion and/or persistence after infusion. In this study, we found that CD5 inhibits CAR T cell activation and that knockout (KO) of CD5 using CRISPR-Cas9 enhances the antitumor effect of CAR T cells in multiple hematological and solid cancer models. Mechanistically, CD5 KO drives increased T cell effector function with enhanced cytotoxicity, in vivo expansion, and persistence, without apparent toxicity in preclinical models. These findings indicate that CD5 is a critical inhibitor of T cell function and a potential clinical target for enhancing T cell therapies. Deleting CD5 with CRISPR-Cas9 enhances T cell activation and proliferation, boosting their antitumor effects in multiple tumor models. Editor’s summary The currently available chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have had limited efficacy for a wide range of solid cancers and hematological malignancies, due in part to CAR T cell dysfunction. The scavenger receptor CD5 associates with the T cell receptor (TCR) and inhibits T cell function. Patel et al. show that genetic deletion of CD5 in CAR and TCR T cells enhances expansion, persistence, and cytotoxicity and is effective in preclinical solid tumor and hematological malignancy models. These results suggest that CD5 may be a critical negative regulator of CAR T cells that can be therapeutically targeted. —Christiana Fogg">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a transformative treatment for various hematological malignancies. Still, its remarkable efficacy is accompanied by unique adverse events that must be carefully managed. This comprehensive literature review evaluates the safety profile of CAR T-cell therapy, focusing on cytopenia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and other potential complications. Cytopenia, characterized by reduced blood cell counts, affects a significant proportion of patients, with rates of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia reaching up to 60%, 70%, and 80%, respectively. Risk factors include high tumor burden, prior chemotherapy, and bone marrow involvement. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurs in 13% to 77% of patients and is linked to the cytokine storm induced by CAR T cells, target antigen expression, and preexisting immune dysregulation. Other notable adverse events discussed are cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, and infections. Understanding the mechanisms, risk factors, and management strategies for these adverse events is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and unlocking the full potential of this revolutionary therapy. The review highlights the need for continued research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and evidence-based approaches to enhance the safety and efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is a novel anticancer therapy using autologous or allogeneic T-cells. To date, six CAR-T therapies for specific B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), and multiple myeloma (MM) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Significant barriers to the effectiveness of CAR-T therapy include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity in the case of Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (Allo-SCT) graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), antigen escape, modest antitumor activity, restricted trafficking, limited persistence, the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and senescence and exhaustion of CAR-Ts. Furthermore, cancer drug resistance remains a major problem in clinical practice. CAR-T therapy, in combination with checkpoint blockades and bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) or other drugs, appears to be an appealing anticancer strategy. Many of these agents have shown impressive results, combining efficacy with tolerability. Biomarkers like extracellular vesicles (EVs), cell-free DNA (cfDNA), circulating tumor (ctDNA) and miRNAs may play an important role in toxicity, relapse assessment, and efficacy prediction, and can be implicated in clinical applications of CAR-T therapy and in establishing safe and efficacious personalized medicine. However, further research is required to fully comprehend the particular side effects of immunomodulation, to ascertain the best order and combination of this medication with conventional chemotherapy and targeted therapies, and to find reliable predictive biomarkers.">

 Monoclonal antibodies are among the most effective treatments for patients with blood cancers, and they primarily function by marking cells for destruction by the innate immune system. Macrophages are critical innate effectors of antibody therapies for lymphoma, but their anti-tumor capacity is limited by the CD47/SIRPa interaction. CD47 acts a “don’t eat me” signal that is highly expressed on the surface of many lymphomas, and it prevents phagocytosis by binding to the inhibitory receptor SIRPa expressed on macrophages. In multiple clinical trials, CD47-blocking therapies have demonstrated encouraging signs of efficacy for B-cell lymphomas, particularly when used in combination with rituximab, an opsonizing anti-CD20 antibody. However, the best antibodies and combination strategies to activate macrophages remains unknown. Here, we sought to define the repertoire of cell surface antigens that can be targeted to stimulate macrophage-mediated destruction of B-cell lymphomas. To achieve this goal, we developed a high-throughput functional screening platform to measure the ability of primary macrophages to attack B-cell lymphoma cells. We successfully applied this system to screen monoclonal antibody libraries targeting hundreds of distinct cell surface antigens across both mouse and human systems. We conducted screens using each antibody as a single agent, in combination with anti-CD20, or in combination with anti-CD47. From these efforts, we identified CD24, CD38, CXCR4, CD71, and multiple other novel and unique antigens that could be targeted alone or in combination to exert maximal macrophage-mediated destruction of B-cell lymphoma. Of note, some of the identified targets are predominantly expressed by the lymphoma cells, whereas others are expressed by the macrophages and act as unappreciated immune checkpoints. In validation studies, we defined a multitude of new antibody combinations that robustly stimulate macrophages to attack and eliminate lymphoma cells. Since some anti-CD47-antibodies have been limited by on-target hematologic toxicity, we also used the identified targets to engineer a collection of novel bispecific antibodies that induce macrophage phagocytosis without causing hematologic toxicity. We generated 156 bispecific antibodies, produced them recombinantly, and demonstrated they can maximize macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity of human B-cell lymphoma cells while minimizing binding to healthy blood cells. In mouse xenograft models, these bispecific antibodies exhibited significant single-agent activity in a model of aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Thus, our study has led to the development of a multitude of novel therapeutic candidates and combination strategies that can be developed further to maximize anti-tumor function and benefit patients with lymphoma. Furthermore, our approach can be rapidly applied to other hematologic malignancies to create innovative bispecific agents that maximize anti-tumor responses by macrophages or other innate immune cells.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells and Bispecific Antibodies (BsAb) are the leading platforms for redirecting the immune system against cells expressing the specific antigen, revolutionizing the treatment of hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM). In MM, drug-resistant relapses are the main therapy-limiting factor and the leading cause of why the disease is still considered incurable. T-cell-engaging therapies hold promise in improving the treatment of MM. However, the effectiveness of these treatments may be hindered by T-cell fitness. T-cell exhaustion is a condition of a gradual decline in effector function, reduced cytokine secretion, and increased expression of inhibitory receptors due to chronic antigen stimulation. Areas covered This review examines findings about T-cell exhaustion in MM in the context of T-cell redirecting BsAbs and CAR-T treatment. Expert opinion The fitness of T-cells has become an important factor in the development of T-cell redirecting therapies. The way T-cell exhaustion relates to these therapies could affect the further development of CAR and BsAbs technologies, as well as the strategies used for clinical use. Therefore, this review aims to explore the current understanding of T-cell exhaustion in MM and its relationship to these therapies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT T-cell engaging (TCE) bispecific antibodies are potent drugs that trigger the immune system to eliminate cancer cells, but administration can be accompanied by toxic side effects that limit dosing. TCEs function by binding to cell surface receptors on T cells, frequently CD3, with one arm of the bispecific antibody while the other arm binds to cell surface antigens on cancer cells. On-target, off-tumor toxicity can arise when the target antigen is also present on healthy cells. The toxicity of TCEs may be ameliorated through the use of pro-drug forms of the TCE, which are not fully functional until recruited to the tumor microenvironment. This can be accomplished by masking the anti-CD3 arm of the TCE with an autoinhibitory motif that is released by tumor-enriched proteases. Here, we solve the crystal structure of the antigen-binding fragment of a novel anti-CD3 antibody, E10, in complex with its epitope from CD3 and use this information to engineer a masked form of the antibody that can activate by the tumor-enriched protease matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2). We demonstrate with binding experiments and in vitro T-cell activation and killing assays that our designed prodrug TCE is capable of tumor-selective T-cell activity that is dependent upon MMP-2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a similar masking strategy can be used to create a pro-drug form of the frequently used anti-CD3 antibody SP34. This study showcases an approach to developing immune-modulating therapeutics that prioritizes safety and has the potential to advance cancer immunotherapy treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Tumor evasion has recently been associated with a novel member of the B7 family, HERV-H LTR-associating 2 (HHLA2), which is mostly overexpressed in PDL-1neg tumors. HHLA2 can either induce a costimulation signal when bound to CD28H or inhibit it by binding to KIR3DL3 on T- and NK cells. Given the broad distribution of CD28H expression on NK cells and its role, we compared two monoclonal antibodies targeting this novel NK-cell engager in this study. We show that targeting CD28H at a specific epitope not only strongly activates Ca2+ flux but also results in NK-cell activation. CD28H-activated NK cells further display increased cytotoxic activity against hematopoietic cell lines and bypass HHLA2 and HLA-E inhibitory signals. Additionally, scRNA-seq analysis of clear cell renal cancer cells revealed that HHLA2+ clear cell renal cancer cell tumors were infiltrated with CD28H+ NK cells, which could be targeted by finely chosen anti-CD28H Abs.">

        <tr id="Immune responses to primary COVID-19 vaccination were investigated in 58 patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) as part of the PETReA trial of frontline therapy (EudraCT 2016-004010-10). COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1) were administered before, during or after cytoreductive treatment comprising rituximab (depletes B cells) and either bendamustine (depletes CD4+ T cells) or cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy. Blood samples obtained after vaccine doses 1 and 2 (V1, V2) were analysed for antibodies and T cells reactive to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the Abbott Architect and interferon-gamma ELISpot assays respectively. Compared to 149 healthy controls, patients with FL exhibited lower antibody but preserved T-cell responses. Within the FL cohort, multivariable analysis identified low pre-treatment serum IgA levels and V2 administration during induction or maintenance treatment as independent determinants of lower antibody and higher T-cell responses, and bendamustine and high/intermediate FLIPI-2 score as additional determinants of a lower antibody response. Several clinical scenarios were identified where dichotomous immune responses were estimated with >95% confidence based on combinations of predictive variables. In conclusion, the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in FL patients is influenced by multiple disease- and treatment-related factors, among which B-cell depletion showed differential effects on antibody and T-cell responses.">

        <tr id="Leveraging endogenous tumor-resident T-cells for immunotherapy using bispecific antibodies (BsAb) targeting CD20 and CD3 has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. However, features associated with treatment response or resistance are unknown. To this end, we analyzed data from patients treated with epcoritamab-containing regimens in the EPCORE NHL-2 trial (NCT04663347). We observed downregulation of CD20 expression on B-cells following treatment initiation both in progressing patients and in patients achieving durable complete responses (CR), suggesting that CD20 downregulation does not universally predict resistance to BsAb-based therapy. Single-cell immune profiling of tumor biopsies obtained following one cycle of therapy revealed substantial clonal expansion of cytotoxic CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in patients achieving CR, and an expansion of follicular helper and regulatory CD4+ T-cells in patients whose disease progressed. These results identify distinct tumor-resident T-cell profiles associated with response or resistance to BsAb therapy.">

Evidence of immune evasion during AML progression, such as HLA loss and T-cell exhaustion, suggests that antileukemic immune responses contribute to disease control and could be harnessed by immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss a spectrum of AML immunotherapy targets, encompassing cancer cell-intrinsic and surface antigens as well as targeting in the leukemic milieu, and how they can be tailored for personalized approaches. These targets are overviewed across major immunotherapy modalities applied to AML: immune checkpoint inhibitors, antibody-drug conjugates, therapeutic vaccines, bispecific/trispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T and CAR-NK cells. Significance: Immune therapies in AML treatment show evolving promise. Ongoing research aims to customize approaches for varied patient profiles and clinical scenarios. This review covers immune surveillance mechanisms, therapy options like checkpoint inhibitors, antibodies, CAR-T/NK cells, and vaccines, as well as resistance mechanisms and microenvironment considerations.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for eradicating human cancers. Their therapeutic success and durability of clinical responses hinges, in large part, on their functional capacity, including the ability of these engineered cells to simultaneously expand and persist after infusion into patients. CD19 CAR T-cell polyfunctionality, assessing the simultaneous functions of cytokine production, proliferation, and cytotoxicity has been reported to correlate with clinical outcomes. Assay optimization is potentially limited by the heterogeneous nature of CAR T-cell infusion products and target specificity. We optimized a single-cell platform for polyfunctionality using CAR T cell products manufactured from healthy donors, engineered against a novel target, BAFF-R, and validated the protocol using CD19 CAR T cells. We observed distinct qualitative differences between BAFF-R and CD19 CAR T cells relative to the proportions of stimulatory vs. effector cytokines, based on target antigen density, and generally, CD19 CAR T cells exhibited lower indices of polyfunctionality. Finally, we applied our assay to the autologous BAFF-R CAR T-cell product generated from the first NHL patient treated on an ongoing clinical trial who had progressed after prior CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. We observed robust indicators of polyfunctionality, which correlated with successful CAR T cell expansion after infusion and achievement of durable complete remission ongoing after 18 months. The precise identification of factors determining the role of BAFF-R CAR T-cell fitness on toxicity and clinical outcome will require the application of this robust assay in the analysis of additional treated patients.">

        <tr id="New hope for patients with specific blood malignancies has arisen with the emergence of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy as a revolutionary approach to cancer immunotherapy. This groundbreaking therapy modifies a patient’s immune system such that their own T cells can identify and destroy cancer-specific antigens by expressing CARs. Multiple myeloma, lymphomas, and leukemias are among the blood malignancies that have been treated with six CAR T-cell treatments that have been approved by the FDA since 2017. The treatment entails drawing T cells out of the patient’s blood, changing their genes to produce CARs, and then reintroducing these modified cells into the patient. The CAR T-cells have the ability to identify cancer cells, proliferate, and kill them once they enter the circulation. This might lead to long-term protection from the illness. Patients with blood malignancies who have relapsed or are resistant to previous treatments have shown encouraging results in clinical studies, with some patients even managing to achieve long-term remissions. Cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicities are two of the many potential adverse effects of CAR T-cell treatment that must be carefully managed. The complicated production method and expensive treatment cost further restrict its broad availability. Research is ongoing with the goals of improving the safety profile, increasing the effectiveness, and expanding the applicability of CAR T-cell therapy to solid tumors.">

In 2017, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy changed the landscape of treatment for patients with R/R DLBCL, with complete response rates ranging from 40-58% and long-term disease-free survival of >40% in the highest risk subgroups, including patients who relapsed after auto-HSCT.

Additionally, a notable treatment advantage of BsAbs is their ability to be administered in the community setting, making treatment more accessible for patients.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Natural killer (NK) cells are key players in human innate immunity. Cell engager antibody formats that recruit and activate NK cells more effectively have emerged as a promising immunotherapy approach to target cancer cells through more effective antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Monoclonal antibody drugs with ADCC activity have shown clinical benefit and improved outcomes for patients with certain types of cancer. CD16a, a Fc gamma III receptor, is the major component that is responsible for the ADCC activity of NK cells. Screening AvantGen’s yeast displayed human antibody libraries led to the isolation of 2 antibody clones, #1A2 and #2-2A2, that selectively recognize both isoforms (F and V) of CD16a on primary NK cells with high affinity, yet minimally (#1A2) or do not (#2-2A2) cross-react with both allelotypes of CD16b (NA1 and NA2) expressed by neutrophils. Epitope mapping studies revealed that they bind to an epitope dependent on residue Y158 of CD16a, since mutation of Y158 to the corresponding CD16b residue H158 completely abolishes binding to CD16a. When formatted as bispecific antibodies targeting CD16a and a tumor-associated antigen (TAA, e.g. CD19), they exhibit specific binding to NK cells and induce potent NK cell activation upon encountering tumor cells, resulting in effective tumor cell killing. Notably, these bispecific antibody engagers stimulate NK cell cytokine release during co-culture with target cells, resulting in target cell cytotoxicity. These anti-CD16a antibody clones are promising candidates for combination with any TAA of interest, offering the potential for novel NK cell engager-based cancer therapeutics that are minimally affected by the high concentrations of human IgG in the circulation.">

        <tr id="Severe and/or refractory dermatological diseases with immunologic origin to conventional therapy have a bad prognosis. Autoimmune blistering diseases have a high morbidity and mortality. Therapeutic apheresis is an essential supportive treatment for severe and refractory dermatological diseases with an immunologic origin, particularly autoimmune blistering diseases. This approach has been shown to significantly improve the prognosis of these diseases. Therapeutic apheresis, combined with immunosuppressive therapy and/or human monoclonal antibodies, has treated successfully autoimmune blistering skin disorders. These diseases are caused by the immune system’s targeting of structural proteins in the skin and/or mucous membranes. Improved diagnostic methods have allowed to determine that the incidence and prevalence of these disorders have doubled in the last 15 years to 25 new cases per million people per year owing to an aging population. Over the last 45 years, therapeutic apheresis, in combination with immunosuppression and/or human monoclonal antibodies, has significantly increased survival rates. Therapeutic apheresis using hollow fiber modules is safe and highly effective in eliminating autoantibodies and other toxins from the bloodstream, leading to rapid clinical improvement in dermatological conditions.

Targeting either FLT3 or CD99 using FLT3-A192 or CD99-A192 led to AML cell death and reduced leukemia burden in AML mouse models.

This dual-targeting Co-Assembled formulation exhibits cytotoxic effects on AML cells (AML cell lines and primary blasts) and reduced leukemia burden and prolonged survival in FLT3-ITD AML mouse models.

        <tr id="Infections are increasingly recognized as a common complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. The incidence of clinically-defined infection after CD19.CAR T-cell therapy for relapsed/refractory lymphoma ranges from 60-90% in the first year after CAR T-cell therapy and is the most common cause for non-relapse mortality. However, infectious risk after CAR T-cell therapy targeting other malignancies is not well understood. Herein, we report for the first time, infectious complications after CD30.CAR T-cell treatment for patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Since CD30 is only expressed on a subset of activated T and B-cells, we hypothesized that CD30.CAR T-cell patients would have reduced incidence and severity of infections after infusion compared to CD19.CAR T-cell patients. We retrospectively evaluated all 64 patients who received CD30.CAR T-cells at a single institution between 2016-2021, and assessed infections within one year after cell infusion, comparing these data to a contemporary cohort of 50 patients who received CD19.CAR T-cells at the same institution between 2018-2021. 23 CD30.CAR T-cell patients (36%) and 18 CD19.CAR T-cell patients (36%) developed a microbiologically confirmed infection. Infection severity and bacterial infections were higher in the CD19.CAR T-cell group compared to CD30.CAR T-cell recipients who more commonly had grade 1 respiratory viral infections. Our data reflect expected outcomes for severity and infection type in CD19.CAR T-cell patients and provide a benchmark for comparison with the novel CD30.CAR T-cell product. Although our findings require replication in a larger cohort, they have implications for antimicrobial prophylaxis guidelines after CD30.CAR T-cell therapy.">

        <tr id="Bispecific and multispecific agents have become increasingly utilized in cancer treatment and immunotherapy, yet their complex design parameters present a challenge in developing successful therapeutics. Bispecifics that crosslink receptors on two opposing cells can provide specific activation of a receptor only when these cells are in close spatial proximity, such as an immune cell and cancer cell in a tumor. These agents, including T cell activating bispecifics, can avoid off-tumor toxicity through activation only in the tumor microenvironment by utilizing a tumor target to cluster T-cell receptors for a selective costimulatory signal. Here, we investigate a panel of PD-1/CD137 targeted Humabody VH domains to determine the key factors for T cell activation, such as affinity, valency, expression level, domain orientation, and epitope location. Target expression is a dominant factor determining both specificity and potency of T cell activation. Given an intrinsic expression level, the affinity can be tuned to modulate the level of activation and IC50 and achieve specificity between low and high expression levels. Changing the epitope location and linker length showed minor improvements to activation at low expression levels, but increasing the valency for the target decreased activation at all expression levels. By combining non-overlapping epitopes for the target, we achieved higher receptor activation at low expression levels. A kinetic model was able to capture these trends, offering support for the mechanistic interpretation. This work provides a framework to quantify factors for T cell activation by cell-crosslinking bispecific agents and guiding principles for the design of new agents.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Yttrium-90 transarterial radioembolization (90Y) can safely and effectively treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Clinical trials combining 90Y with immunotherapy are aimed at improving treatment response rates. The impact of transient 90Y-induced lymphopenia on T-cell homeostasis and functional dynamics are unknown.


DESIGN
Paired blood specimen were collected prior to first-cycle 90Y and at imaging follow-up in patients with HCC stage BCLC-A-B. Flow cytometry and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing were used to monitor changes in T-cell subsets and TCR repertoire following 90Y. Objective response (OR) rates were determined using mRECIST and defined as either OR or non-objective (NOR). Time-to-progression(TTP) was defined as progression to BCLC-C within 6-months following 90Y.


RESULTS
90Y induced shifts in both CD4+ (P=0.049) and CD8+ (P<0.001) toward an effector memory (TEM) response independent of treatment response rate. Non-responders to 90Y were characterized by a sustained elevation in both naïve CD4+ cells (P=0.019) and PD-1 expression in CD8+ cells (P=0.003). Paired analysis of the TCR repertoire revealed a variable induction of neoantigen clonotypes and expansion of existing clonotypes independent of 90Y response. In patients with an OR, changes in TCR clonality did not influence TTP. However, polyclonal profiles in patients without an OR were associated with shorter TTP (P=0.005, HR10.8) and 75% disease progression rates 6-months following treatment.


CONCLUSION
90Y induces a population shift from central to effector memory accompanied by neoantigen T-cell responses independent of treatment response rate. Monoclonal shifts in the post-90Y T-cell repertoire had superior overall TTP and improved TTP in patients with a first-cycle NOR.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Mogamulizumab is an anti-C-C chemokine receptor 4 antibody that is increasingly being used to treat T-cell malignancies such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Because CCR4 is expressed on both malignant T-cells and regulatory T-cells (Tregs), mogamulizumab can be associated with increased immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While there is abundant literature on mogamulizumab-associated rash (MAR) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), other reported irAEs have not been collated into a single review.


AREAS COVERED
This narrative review covers irAEs associated with mogamulizumab in patients with T-cell lymphomas, focusing on events other than MAR and GVHD. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for case reports, case series, chart reviews, and clinical trials published from inception to March 2024. Identified events include alopecia, vitiligo, arthritis, psoriasis, myocarditis, myositis/polymyositis, hepatitis, and others.


EXPERT OPINION
Mogamulizumab's ability to augment the host immune response through Treg depletion adds to its efficacy but has wide-ranging implications for autoimmunity across multiple organ systems, similar to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Occurrence of irAEs may be associated with improved overall clinical response, although long-term follow-up studies are needed.">

        <tr id="Recent studies demonstrating the feasibility of outpatient chimeric antigen receptor modified (CAR) T-cell therapy administration are either restricted to CARs with 41BB costimulatory domains or employ intensive at-home monitoring. We report outcomes of outpatient administration of all commercially available CD19- and BCMA-directed CAR-T therapy using a strategy of no remote at-home monitoring and an early cytokine release syndrome (CRS) intervention strategy. Patients with hematologic malignancies who received CAR T-cell therapy in the outpatient setting during 2022-23 were included. Patients were seen daily in the cancer center day hospital for the first 7-10 days and then twice weekly through day 30. The primary endpoint was to determine 3-, 7- and 30-day post CAR T-cell infusion hospitalizations. Early CRS intervention involved administering tocilizumab as an outpatient for grade ≥1 CRS. 58 patients received outpatient CAR T-cell infusion (33 myeloma, 24 lymphoma and 1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia). Of these, 17 (41%), 16 (38%), and 9 (21%) patients were admitted between days 0-3, 4-7 and 8-30 post-CAR T-cell infusion, respectively. The most common reason for admission was CAR T-cell-related toxicities (33/42). Hospitalization was prevented in 15 out of 35 patients who received tocilizumab for CRS as an outpatient. The non-relapse mortality rates were 1.7% at 1 month and 3.4% at 6 months. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the administration of commercial CAR T-cell therapies in an outpatient setting is safe and feasible without intensive remote monitoring employing an early CRS intervention strategy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives To evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of autologous haematopoiesis stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) for severe, refractory autoimmune diseases in paediatric patients. Methods A single-centre study of consecutive children and adolescents with refractory autoimmune diseases undergoing AHSCT was performed. Demographics, clinical, laboratory features, pre-AHSCT medications, disease activity and functional status were captured. The primary outcome was progression-free survival, secondary outcomes included overall survival, disease-specific treatment responses, disease activity at the last follow-up and AHSCT safety. Results The study included seven patients: two systemic sclerosis, one pansclerotic morphoea, one eosinophilic fasciitis, one juvenile dermatomyositis and two patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis; four women, three men median age at AHSCT of 10 years (7–19), median follow-up post-AHSCT of 17 years. Median progression-free survival and overall survival was 4.2 years (95% CI: 0.98 to 8.3) and 17 years (95% CI: 11.8 to 22.1), respectively. Progression-free survival rates at 1 and 2 years post-AHSCT were 100% and 77%, respectively. All children survived. All patients are in clinical remission, only four require ongoing immunotherapy. Safety: Three experienced infections, including HHV6, Candida and Ralstonia sepsis; one developed a systemic inflammatory response syndrome; two new onset secondary autoimmune diseases including autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, Graves’ disease and one was found to have a breast fibroadenoma. Treatment toxicity: one cyclophosphamide-associated transient renal failure and pericardial effusion, one patient with amenorrhoea/infertility. Conclusions AHSCT was an effective and safe approach for children and adolescents with treatment-refractory autoimmune diseases. The indication and timing of transplantation requires a careful consideration and a multidisciplinary approach.">

The expansion kinetics of CAR T cells during the ﬁ rst month after infusion were compared across the different B-cell lymphoma subtypes and also across patients with varying grades of treatment-related toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and prolonged neutropenia. One key ﬁ nding of this study is the strikingly more robust expansion of CAR T cells in patients with MCL compared with those with LBCL or FL with signi ﬁ cantly higher levels of peripheral blood CAR T cells in the former group across the different time points. The authors provide a potential mechanistic explanation by analyzing a separate messenger RNA microarray data set, which revealed signi ﬁ cantly higher CD19 expression in patients with MCL compared with those with LBCL or FL. In addition to proportionally greater CD19 target – driven expansion of CAR T cells, other factors to consider include product differences between axi-cel and brexu-cel and the possible potentiating effect of prior Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor use on T-cell function in">

We report a case of successful anti-CD19 CAR T cell use in treatment-refractory stiff-person syndrome (SPS). To investigate clinical and immunological effects of anti-CD19 CAR T cell use in treatment-refractory SPS, a 69-y-old female with a 9-y history of treatment-refractory SPS with deteriorating episodes of stiffness received an infusion of autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cells (KYV-101) and was monitored clinically and immunologically for more than 6 mo. CAR T cell infusion resulted in reduced leg stiffness, drastic improvement in gait, walking speed increase over 100%, and daily walking distance improvement from less than 50 m to over 6 km within 3 mo. GABAergic medication (benzodiazepines) was reduced by 40%. KYV-101 CAR T cells were well tolerated with only low-grade cytokine release syndrome. This report of successful use of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in treatment-refractory SPS supports continued exploration of this approach in SPS and other B cell–related autoimmune disorders.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL) has a critical role in improving outcomes. Access to CAR T-cell therapy is limited for international patients for whom standard therapies have failed, forcing many to undertake substantial travel in search of a cure. Our institution offers phase I CAR T-cell clinical trials for pediatric, and adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients, and is one of few that can accept patients nationally and internationally. This was a retrospective study of international patients with r/r B-ALL enrolled on a CAR T-cell trial at the pediatric oncology branch (POB) from 6/2012 through 3/2021. Variables including demographics and prior therapies (among others) were manually extracted from the electronic medical records, and analyzed using Microsoft Excel and R software, version 4.3. A total of 57 patients (71.9% male) were included, including 35 (61.4%) from high income countries (World Bank Classification), 14 (24.6%) from upper-middle income countries, and 8 (14.0%) from low-middle income countries. Most common referrals were for a relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and/or CAR T-cell (43.9%), followed by CD19 negative relapse/refractory disease (29.8%). Twenty-six patients (45.6%) were enrolled for CD22, 21 (36.8%) for CD19, and 10 (17.6%) for dual CD19/CD22 directed CAR T-cell therapy. The median number of prior therapy lines was 5 (range 2-12, Q1 = 4, Q2 = 6). Thirty-five patients (61.4%) underwent at least one prior HSCT, 29 (50.1%) had received prior immunotherapy, and 19 patients (33.3%) received at least one prior CAR T-cell at other institutions “Only 3 of 21 CAR T-cell products (14.3%) were received in the patient's home country. Twenty-six patients (45.6%) received chemotherapy to control the disease during travel to our institution for enrollment, 47 patients (82.5%) received at least one anti-microbial prophylactic agent, and 26 patients (49.1%) had central venous access on arrival. Median age at CAR T-cell infusion was 13 years (Q1 = 9, Q3 = 20). Our study is the largest to describe prior lines of therapy and treatment paths for international pediatric and AYA patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL undergoing CAR T-cell therapy. Characterizing prior therapies and paths of this heavily treated population will help inform future directions in expanding this novel immunotherapy availability and addressing access disparities across the world.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cell (CAR T-cell) therapy has revolutionized the management of hematological malignancies. In addition to impressive malignancy-related outcomes, CAR T-cell therapy has significant toxicity-related adverse events, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT), and opportunistic infections. Different CAR T-cell targets have different epidemiology and risk factors for infection, and these targets result in different long-term immunodeficiency states due to their distinct on-target and off- tumor effects. These effects are exacerbated by the use of multimodal immunosuppression in the management of CRS and ICANS. The most effective course of action for managing infectious complications involves determining screening, prophylactic, and monitoring strategies and understanding the role of immunoglobulin replacement and re-vaccination strategies. This involves considering the nature of prior immunomodulating therapies, underlying malignancy, the CAR T-cell target, and the development and management of related adverse events. In conclusion, we now have an increasing understanding of infection management for CAR T-cell recipients. As additional effector cells and CAR T-cell targets become available, infection management strategies will continue to evolve.">

        <tr id="Introduction Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) can simultaneously target two epitopes of different antigenic targets, bringing possibilities for diversity in antibody drug design and are promising tools for the treatment of cancers and other diseases. T-cell engaging bsAb is an important application of the bispecific antibody, which could promote T cell-mediated tumor cell killing by targeting tumor-associated antigen (TAA) and CD3 at the same time. Methods This study comprised antibodies purification, Elisa assay for antigen binding, cytotoxicity assays, T cell activation by flow cytometry in vitro and xenogenic tumor model in vivo. Results We present a novel bsAb platform named PHE-Ig technique to promote cognate heavy chain (HC)-light chain (LC) pairing by replacing the CH1/CL regions of different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with the natural A and B chains of PHE1 fragment of Integrin β2 based on the knob-in-hole (KIH) technology. We had also verified that PHE-Ig technology can be effectively used as a platform to synthesize different desired bsAbs for T-cell immunotherapy. Especially, BCMA×CD3 PHE-Ig bsAbs exhibited robust anti-multiple myeloma (MM) activity in vitro and in vivo. Discussion Moreover, PHE1 domain was further shortened with D14G and R41S mutations, named PHE-S, and the PHE-S-based BCMA×CD3 bsAbs also showed anti BCMA+ tumor effect in vitro and in vivo, bringing more possibilities for the development and optimization of different bsAbs. To sum up, PHE1-based IgG-like antibody platform for bsAb construction provides a novel strategy for enhanced T-cell immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease in which multiple organs are damaged by the immune system. Although standard treatment options such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), glucocorticoids (GCs), and other immunosuppressive or immune-modulating agents can help to manage symptoms, they do not offer a cure. Hence, there is an urgent need for the development of novel drugs and therapies. In recent decades, cell therapies have been used for the treatment of SLE with encouraging results. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, mesenchymal stem cells, regulatory T (Treg) cell, natural killer cells, and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cells are advanced cell therapies which have been developed and evaluated in clinical trials in humans. In clinical application, each of these approaches has shown advantages and disadvantages. In addition, further studies are necessary to conclusively establish the safety and efficacy of these therapies. This review provides a summary of recent clinical trials investigating cell therapies for SLE treatment, along with a discussion on the potential of other cell-based therapies.

        <tr id="Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for various hematological, immunological and metabolic diseases, replacing the patient’s hematopoietic system with donor-derived healthy hematopoietic stem cells. HSCT can be complicated by early and late events related to impaired immunological recovery such as prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia post-HSCT. We present a 16-year-old female patient with sickle-cell disease who underwent HSCT with stem cells from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class-II mismatched family donor. While cellular recovery was good post-HSCT, the patient developed mixed chimerism and suffered from cervical lymphadenopathy, recurrent airway infections and cutaneous SLE. She presented with hypogammaglobulinemia and was started on immunoglobulin substitution therapy and antibiotic prophylaxis. B-cell phenotyping showed that she had increased transitional and naïve mature B cells, reduced memory B cells, and diminished marginal zone/natural effector cells. In-depth immunophenotyping and B-cell receptor repertoire sequencing ruled out an intrinsic B-cell defect by expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), presence of somatic hypermutations and differentiation into IgG- and IgA-producing plasma cells in vitro. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry of lymph node tissue showed a clear block in terminal B-cell differentiation. Chimerism analysis of sorted lymph node populations showed that exclusively patient-derived B cells populated germinal centers, while only a minor fraction of follicular helper T cells was patient-derived. Given this discrepancy, we deduced that the HLA class-II disparity between patient and donor likely hinders terminal B-cell differentiation in the lymph node. This case highlights that studying disturbed cognate T-B interactions in the secondary lymphoid organs can provide unique insights when deciphering prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia post-HSCT.">

        <tr id="Despite significant progress in basic and preclinical research into acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the five-year survival rate for patients with AML remains poor, highlighting the urgent need for new combination therapies. Over the past decade, increased attention has been focused on identifying suitable immunotherapeutic strategies to combat AML, in particular targeting leukaemia cells and their precursors with cytokines. Targeted therapy is also an established approach for the treatment of AML. However, with the increasing number of treatment options, there are challenges in understanding how to select the most effective therapy and how to combine different drugs. Venetoclax is a targeted agent, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of B cell lymphoma protein-2 (BCL-2), one of the cell’s major anti-apoptotic proteins. Research into approaches to improve the treatment of AML remains challenging due to the limitations of experimental models. Despite improvements in ex vivo culture protocols, in vivo models remain the only way to study the inherently heterogeneous nature of AML and the influence of the microenvironment on leukaemia development. In our study, we show that in a xenograft mouse model of acute myeloid leukaemia in mice of the NSG-SGM3 line, there is an increase in serum IL-4 in response to venetoclax therapy. IL-4 has previously been shown to induce apoptosis in AML cells. These data provide new perspectives for the use of strategies based on the synergism of venetoclax and IL-4 in inducing apoptosis. The data also show an increase in serum human MCP-1 levels upon engraftment of OCI-AML-2 leukaemia cells in the serum of xenografted mice, which decreases after venetoclax therapy and may serve as a prognostic marker for the success of ongoing therapy. An obvious advantage of xenograft models in mice was the ability to separate the expression and secretion of murine cytokines and chemokines that determine the microenvironmental response from the cytokine profile of the human tumor cells themselves. Overall, our data suggest additional functional features of venetoclax action on tumor cells through the regulation of cytokine secretion and the prospect of using the immunodeficient mouse line NSG-SGM3 to test new approaches to the treatment of AML.">

        <tr id="Immune cell engagers are molecular agents, usually antibody-based constructs, engineered to recruit immune cells against cancer cells and kill them. They represent a versatile and powerful tool for cancer immunotherapy. Despite the multiplication of new engagers tested and accepted in the clinics, how molecular and cellular parameters influence their action is poorly understood. In particular, disentangling the respective role of host immune cells and engager biophysical characteristics is needed to improve their design and efficiency. Focusing here on harnessing antibody dependent Natural Killer cell cytotoxicity, we measure the efficiency of 6 original bispecific antibodies (bsAb), associating an anti-HER2 nanobody and an anti-CD16 nanobody. In vitro cytotoxicity data using primary human NK cells on different target cell lines exposing different antigen densities were collected, exhibiting a wide range of bsAb dose response. In order to rationalize our observations, we introduce a simple multiscale model, postulating that the density of bsAb bridging the two cells is the main parameter triggering the cytotoxic response. We introduce two new microscopic parameters: the surface cooperativity describing bsAb affinity at the bridging step and the threshold of bridge density determining the donor-dependent response. Both parameters permit to rank Abs and donors and to predict bsAb potency as a function of antibodies bulk affinities and receptor surface densities on cells. Our approach thus provides a general way to decouple donor response from immune engagers characteristics, rationalizing the landscape of molecule design.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction. Treatment with CM313, a novel anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, can result in targeted clearance of CD38-positive cells, including plasma cells.


METHODS
We conducted a phase 1-2, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CM313 in adult patients with ITP. CM313 was administered intravenously at a dose of 16 mg per kilogram of body weight every week for 8 weeks, followed by a 16-week follow-up period. The primary outcomes were adverse events and documentation of two or more consecutive platelet counts of at least 50×109 per liter within 8 weeks after the first dose of CM313. The status of peripheral-blood immune cells in patients and changes in the mononuclear phagocytic system in passive mouse models of ITP receiving anti-CD38 therapy were monitored.


RESULTS
Of the 22 patients included in the study, 21 (95%) had two consecutive platelet counts of at least 50×109 per liter during the treatment period, with a median cumulative response duration of 23 weeks (interquartile range, 17 to 24). The median time to the first platelet count of at least 50×109 per liter was 1 week (range, 1 to 3). The most common adverse events that occurred during the study were infusion-related reaction (in 32% of the patients) and upper respiratory tract infection (in 32%). After CD38-targeted therapy, the percentage of CD56dimCD16+ natural killer cells, the expression of CD32b on monocytes in peripheral blood, and the number of macrophages in the spleen of the passive mouse models of ITP all decreased.


CONCLUSIONS
In this study, anti-CD38 targeted therapy rapidly boosted platelet levels by inhibiting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity on platelets, maintained long-term efficacy by clearing plasma cells, and was associated with mainly low-grade toxic effects.

        <tr id="CD19-targeted CAR-T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of relapsed/refractory (r/r) pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, it can be associated with acute toxicities related to immune activation, particularly cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Cytokines released from activated immune cells play a key role in their pathophysiology. This study was a prospective analysis of proinflammatory proteins and cytokines in children treated with tisagenlecleucel. Serial measurements of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, ferritin, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFNγ, and TNFα were taken before treatment and on consecutive days after infusion. The incidence of CRS was 77.8%, and the incidence of ICANS was 11.1%. No CRS of grade ≥ 3 was observed. All complications occurred within 14 days following infusion. Higher biomarker concentrations were found in children with CRS grade ≥ 2. Their levels were correlated with disease burden and CAR-T cell dose. While cytokine release syndrome was common, most cases were mild, primarily due to low disease burden before lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LDC). ICANS occurred less frequently but exhibited various clinical courses. None of the toxicities were fatal. All of the analyzed biomarkers rose within 14 days after CAR-T infusion, with most reaching their maximum around the third day following the procedure.">

Scleromyxedema (SM) is a rare skin disorder related to monoclonal gammopathy. High dose intravenous immunoglobulins (HDIVIg) are usually used as a frontline therapy with initial efficacy. However, some patients evolve with relapse, refractory state or severe extra-cutaneous complications such as dermato-neuro syndrome (DNS) or cardiac involvement. The objective of the study is to evaluate the use of anti-plasma cell treatment in these patients in order to obtain a deep and durable dermatological and haematological response.


METHODS
We report here eight patients treated with HDIVIg together with anti-plasma cell therapy including: lenalidomide and dexamethasone (n = 5); bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (n = 1); daratumumab, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (n = 2).


RESULTS
Combination of HDIVIg with a treatment targeting the monoclonal component led to a high level of haematological remission and drastically improved skin response with an acceptable safety profile in all patients. Moreover, HDIVIg was reduced and stopped in 4 of the 7 patients who achieved complete remission.


CONCLUSIONS
The association of lenalidomide and dexamethasone with HDIVIg could improve the treatment of relapsed or severe SM.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Advances in pediatric oncology have occurred for some cancers; however, new therapies for sarcoma have been inadequate. Cellular immunotherapy using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells has shown dramatic benefits in leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma but has been far less successful in pediatric solid tumors such as rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and osteosarcoma (OS). Balancing issues of “on-target, off-tumor toxicity”, investigators have identified B7-H3 as a broadly expressed tumor antigen with otherwise restricted expression on normal tissues. We hypothesized that rapid homing via a chemokine receptor and CAR engagement through B7-H3 would enhance CAR T cell efficacy in solid tumors. Methods We generated B7-H3 CAR T cells that also express the Interleukin-8 (IL-8) receptor, CXCR2. Cytokine production, flow cytometry, Seahorse assays and RNA sequencing were used to compare the B7-H3 CXCR2 (BC2) CAR T cells with B7-H3 CAR T cells. We developed an IL-8 overexpressing human RMS mouse model to test homing and cytotoxicity in vivo. Results We demonstrate that IL-8 is expressed by RMS and OS and expression significantly increases after radiation. Overexpression of an IL-8 receptor, CXCR2, on B7-H3 CAR T cells enhances homing into IL-8 expressing tumors, augments T cell metabolism and leads to significant tumor regression. Conclusion These findings warrant further investigation into the use of BC2 CAR T cells as a treatment for patients with RMS, OS and other B7-H3-expressing, IL-8 producing solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Discovered over 4 decades ago in the supernatants of activated T cells, interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a potent pleiotropic cytokine involved in the regulation of immune responses. It is required for effector T cell expansion and differentiation as well as for peripheral tolerance induced by regulatory T cells. High-dose IL-2 treatment was the first FDA-approved immunotherapy for renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, achieving single agent complete and durable responses, albeit only in a small proportion of patients. The therapeutic potential of wild type IL-2 is clinically limited by its short half-life and severe vascular toxicity. Moreover, the activation of regulatory T cells and the terminal differentiation of effector T cells on IL-2 pose additional restrictions. To overcome the toxicity of IL-2 in order to realize its full potential for patients, several novel engineering strategies are being developed and IL-2 based immunotherapy for cancer has emerged as a burgeoning field of clinical and experimental research. In addition, combination of IL-2 with PD-1/L1 pathway blockade shows vastly improved anti-tumor efficacy over either monotherapy in preclinical tumor models. In this review we discuss the biological characteristics of IL-2 and its receptors, as well as its efficacy and treatment limiting toxicities in cancer patients. We also explore the efforts aimed at developing novel and safer IL-2 therapies to harness the full therapeutic potential of this cytokine.">

        <tr id="The activity of anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with Richter's transformation (RT) to aggressive large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) is largely unknown. In a multicenter retrospective study, we report the safety and efficacy of CAR T cell therapy in patients with RT (n=30) compared to patients with aggressive B cell lymphoma (n=283) and patients with transformed indolent Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (iNHL) (n=141) between April 2016 and January 2023. Two-thirds of patients received prior therapy for CLL before RT and 89% of them received B-cell receptor and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. Toxicities of CAR T cell therapy in RT were similar to other lymphomas, with no fatalities related to cytokine release syndrome or immune effector-cell associated neurotoxicity synderome. The 100-day overall response rate and complete response rates in patients with RT were 57% and 47%, respectively. With a median follow up of 19 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 9.9 months in patients with RT compared to 18 months in de-novo LBCL and not reached in patients with transformed iNHL. The OS at 12 months was 45% in patients with RT compared with 62% and 75% in patients with de novo LBCL and transformed iNHL, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, worse OS was associated with RT histology, elevated LDH, and more prior lines of therapy. CAR T cell therapy can salvage a proportion of patients with CLL and RT exposed to prior targeted agents; however, efficacy in RT is inferior compared to de novo LBCL and transformed iNHL.">

        <tr id="Introduction Therapeutic antibodies have become a major strategy to treat oncologic diseases. For chronic lymphocytic leukemia, antibodies against CD20 are used to target and elicit cytotoxic responses against malignant B cells. However, efficacy is often compromised due to a suppressive microenvironment that interferes with cellular immune responses. To overcome this suppression, agonists of pattern recognition receptors have been studied which promote direct cytotoxicity or elicit anti-tumoral immune responses. NOD2 is an intracellular pattern recognition receptor that participates in the detection of peptidoglycan, a key component of bacterial cell walls. This detection then mediates the activation of multiple signaling pathways in myeloid cells. Although several NOD2 agonists are being used worldwide, the potential benefit of these agents in the context of antibody therapy has not been explored. Methods Primary cells from healthy-donor volunteers (PBMCs, monocytes) or CLL patients (monocytes) were treated with versus without the NOD2 agonist L18-MDP, then antibody-mediated responses were assessed. In vivo, the Eµ-TCL1 mouse model of CLL was used to test the effects of L18-MDP treatment alone and in combination with anti-CD20 antibody. Results Treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with L18-MDP led to activation of monocytes from both healthy donors and CLL patients. In addition, there was an upregulation of activating FcγR in monocytes and a subsequent increase in antibody-mediated phagocytosis. This effect required the NF-κB and p38 signaling pathways. Treatment with L18-MDP plus anti-CD20 antibody in the Eµ-TCL model of CLL led to a significant reduction of CLL load, as well as to phenotypic changes in splenic monocytes and macrophages. Conclusions Taken together, these results suggest that NOD2 agonists help overturn the suppression of myeloid cells, and may improve the efficacy of antibody therapy for CLL.">

 The interleukin-4/13 receptor antagonist dupilumab dramatically changed the landscape of eczema treatment following NICE approval in 2018, and many patients now achieve remission or significant symptomatic improvement without notable side-effects. This has led to a rapid uptake in use; our department has > 300 patients with eczema currently taking dupilumab. However, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) can mimic eczema and may respond to conventional systemic therapies; an unproven relationship with dupilumab exists (Park A, Wong L, Lang A et al. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma following dupilumab use: a systematic review. Int J Dermatol 2023; 62: 962–76). Between 2019 and 2022, five dupilumab-treated patients with ‘eczema’ at our centre were found to have CTCL: three Sézary syndrome (one now deceased) and two atypical CTCL. Whether they had pre-existing CTCL or dupilumab had altered their phenotype was unknown; two of our patients with Sézary syndrome had lifelong eczema. We therefore introduced peripheral blood flow cytometric evaluation as part of our routine dupilumab examinations and 4 months after starting treatment. Furthermore, any patient with atypical eczema received a biopsy prior to starting dupilumab. From June to December 2023, 55 patients (29 female) from our complex eczema clinic started dupilumab. The mean age was 41 years (range 19–90). In total, 62% had atopy, 62% had a family history of eczema and 76% had had eczema since childhood. At baseline, 29% had abnormal peripheral blood flows, but none had Sézary syndrome. Abnormal findings included elevated and reduced CD4 : CD8 ratios (7% and 5%, respectively). Two had clonal changes. So far, in patients with a normal flow completing 4 months of treatment, 50% had normal levels when retested. Abnormal repeat flows in this group included reversed or elevated CD4 : CD8 ratio and new non-Sézary clonal change. Of patients with an abnormal baseline flow, 75% remained static when retested on treatment. One patient’s abnormal clonal population had changed phenotype. Nine patients with atypical eczema had pre-dupilumab biopsies, but none showed features of CTCL. Of the five previously identified patients with CTCL on dupilumab, one responded well to dupilumab and four did not respond. The two patients without Sézary syndrome were both biopsied 1–2 years prior to starting dupilumab, with no suggestion of CTCL. We advocate further investigation including biopsy and flow cytometry in atypical cases prior to dupilumab initiation, as dupilumab can cause CTCL progression in later stages. Flow cytometry is not typically carried out on patients with inflammatory disease, and almost one-third of our patients had an abnormal flow. Prescribers must remain vigilant for unrecognized severe side-effects with new medications. It is reassuring that we have not identified any cases of CTCL from our baseline screening so far, but we cannot exclude the possibility of CTCL developing after starting dupilumab, and we are continuing to monitor these patients.">

        <tr id="Delayed-type drug hypersensitivity reactions are major causes of morbidity and mortality. The origin, phenotype and function of pathogenic T cells across the spectrum of severity requires investigation. We leveraged recent technical advancements to study skin-resident memory T cells (TRM) versus recruited T cell subsets in the pathogenesis of severe systemic forms of disease, SJS/TEN and DRESS, and skin-limited disease, morbilliform drug eruption (MDE). Microscopy, bulk transcriptional profiling and scRNAseq + CITEseq + TCRseq supported in SJS/TEN clonal expansion and recruitment of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells from circulation into skin, along with expanded and non-expanded cytotoxic CD8+ skin TRM. Comparatively, MDE displayed a cytotoxic T cell profile in skin without appreciable expansion and recruitment of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells from circulation, implicating TRM as potential protagonists in skin-limited disease. Mechanistic interrogation in patients unable to recruit T cells from circulation into skin and in a parallel mouse model supported that skin TRM were sufficient to mediate MDE. Concomitantly, SJS/TEN displayed a reduced regulatory T cell (Treg) signature compared to MDE. DRESS demonstrated recruitment of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells into skin like SJS/TEN, yet a pro-Treg signature like MDE. These findings have important implications for fundamental skin immunology and clinical care.">

Limited data regarding CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy in relapsed/refractory (R/R) THRLBCL suggest poor efficacy. We investigated CART outcomes for R/R THRLBCL through the CIBMTR registry. A total of 58 adult patients with R/R THRLBCL who received commercial CD19-CART between 2018-2022 were identified. Most patients (67%) had early relapse of disease (45% primary refractory) with a median of 3 (range: 1-7) prior therapies and were treated with Axicabtagene ciloleucel (69%). At median follow-up of 23 months post-CART, 2-year overall and progression-free survival were 42% (95% CI: 27-57) and 29% (95% CI: 17-43), respectively. In univariable analysis, poor performance status pre-CART was associated with higher mortality (HR 2.35, 95%CI 1.02-5.5). The 2-year cumulative incidences of relapse/progression and non-relapse mortality were 69% and 2%, respectively. Grade ≥3 CRS and ICANS occurred in 7% and 15% of patients, respectively. In this largest analysis of CD19-CART for R/R THRLBCL, approximately 30% of patients were alive and progression-free 2 years post-CART. Despite a high incidence of progression (69% at 2 years), these results suggest a subset of patients with R/R THRLBCL may have durable responses with CART.">

        <tr id="Hematological tumors are a significant disease that poses a serious threat to human health, with morbidity and mortality rates ranking among the highest for all types of tumors. Targeted and immunotherapy for hematological tumors have made significant progress in various aspects, and the utilization of new drugs has enhanced the overall effectiveness of treating hematological tumors. As medicine enters a new era of personalized treatment, monoclonal antibody drugs, with their unique mechanism of action and high efficiency, play an immeasurably important role in the treatment of malignant tumors. Monoclonal antibodies are also utilized as targeting agents for delivering nanomedicines containing cytotoxic payloads or directly linked to cytotoxic drugs. The use of monoclonal antibodies has become a popular treatment for hematologic tumors, as evidenced by significant commercial success. The main features of monoclonal antibody drugs compared to traditional chemical drugs are that monoclonal antibodies are biological drugs with higher biotransformation efficiency, i.e., a higher success rate, and fewer side effects. However, targeted drug monotherapy often yields poor remission rates, and the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy need further enhancement. This article will begin by discussing hematological oncology and provide an overview of the principles, advantages, and disadvantages of several common monoclonal antibody drugs currently available on the market. It will also explore the potential for combined use of monoclonal antibodies, offering direction and assistance for future research in this field.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary B7H4 emerges as a promising therapeutic target exhibiting negative costimulatory activity and whose expression is aberrant in a wide range of solid tumours. This molecule has obtained increased attention as the immune checkpoint is highly expressed in immune “cold” tumours in which the presence of PD-1 and PD-L1- is minimal, making these tumours unresponsive to most currently used immunotherapies. Deficient expression of B7H4 in normal tissue and its overexpression in malignant neoplasms makes B7H4 an attractive immunotherapy agent with potentially lower toxicity than anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 treatment. Numerous clinical trials have evaluated B7H4 targeting immunotherapy using various treatment modalities, including monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, and CAR T cells. In this review, we aimed to update the current state of knowledge regarding B7H4’s role in tumour promotion and immune evasion and summarise results from clinical trials assessing immunotherapies targeting B7H4 in solid tumours. Abstract Anti-cancer immunotherapies entirely changed the therapeutic approach to oncological patients. However, despite the undeniable success of anti-PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 antibody treatments, their effectiveness is limited either by certain types of malignancies or by the arising problem of cancer resistance. B7H4 (aliases B7x, B7H4, B7S1, VTCN1) is a member of a B7 immune checkpoint family with a distinct expression pattern from classical immune checkpoint pathways. The growing amount of research results seem to support the thesis that B7H4 might be a very potent therapeutic target. B7H4 was demonstrated to promote tumour progression in immune “cold” tumours by promoting migration, proliferation of tumour cells, and cancer stem cell persistence. B7H4 suppresses T cell effector functions, including inflammatory cytokine production, cytolytic activity, proliferation of T cells, and promoting the polarisation of naïve CD4 T cells into induced Tregs. This review aimed to summarise the available information about B7H4, focusing in particular on clinical implications, immunological mechanisms, potential strategies for malignancy treatment, and ongoing clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Objective Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is an emerging and effective therapy for relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL). The characteristic toxicities of CAR T cell therapy include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and prolonged cytopenia. We investigated the factors associated with these complications after CAR T cell therapy by analyzing lymphocyte subsets following CAR T cell infusion. Methods We retrospectively analyzed peripheral blood samples on days 7, 14, and 28 after tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) infusion by flow cytometry at our institution between June 2020 and September 2022. Patients Thirty-five patients with R/R DLBCL who received tisa-cel therapy were included. Results A flow cytometry-based analysis of blood samples from these patients revealed that the proportion of CD4+CD25+CD127+ T cells (hereafter referred to as “activated CD4+ T cells”) among the total CD4+ T cells on day 7 after tisa-cel infusion correlated with the duration of CRS (r=0.79, p<0.01). In addition, a prognostic analysis of the overall survival (OS) using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves indicated a significantly more favorable OS and progression-free survival of patients with a proportion of activated CD4+ T cells among the total CD4+ T cells <0.73 (p=0.01, and p<0.01, respectively). Conclusion These results suggest that the proportion of activated CD4+ T cells on day 7 after tisa-cel infusion correlates with the CRS duration and predicts clinical outcomes after CAR T cell therapy. Further studies with a larger number of patients are required to validate these observations.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, which has demonstrated notable efficacy against B-cell malignancies and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use in this context, represents a significant milestone in cancer immunotherapy. However, the efficacy of CAR-T therapy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is poor. The challenges associated with the application of CAR-T therapy for the clinical treatment of AML include, but are not limited to, nonspecific distribution of AML therapeutic targets, difficulties in the production of CAR-T cells, AML blast cell heterogeneity, the immunosuppressive microenvironment in AML, and treatment-related adverse events. In this review, we summarize the recent findings regarding various therapeutic targets for AML (CD33, CD123, CLL1, CD7, etc.) and the results of the latest clinical studies on these targets. Thereafter, we also discuss the challenges related to CAR-T therapy for AML and some promising strategies for overcoming these challenges, including novel approaches such as gene editing and advances in CAR design.">

        <tr id="Background: Cancer cells are cells which have relinquished their capacity to adhere to typical regulatory controls. As cancer progresses, it can spread to adjacent tissues, posing   significant risk to one's survival. Current approach towards cancer management involves; Surgery, Radiotherapy, Chemotherapy and Cyber-knife. These produce immunosuppression, which could last from 6 weeks to several years. Current dogma of cancer progression is linked to the immune status of the patient; important to balance the immune markers for cancer patients. Efforts to reset the body's immune system clock can lead to improved disease outcomes and prognosis. Key Facts: T cells serve as the defenders of the immune system and defend the body from cancer. Non-specific activation of T-cells leads to increased T-cell numbers, discharge of pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor cytokines. Cells that are not specific to antigens can identify tumor cells by recognizing stress signals, causing them to destroy the tumor cells and release hidden tumor antigens. Cytokines produced by different cells attract immune cells, such as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that ingest tumor antigens, triggering the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific to those antigens.  Cells, whether specific to antigens or not, demonstrate the ability to fight against tumor cells by selectively attacking tumor antigens and stress signals. The secretion of cytokines by antigen-specific cells serves to sustain and perpetually attract cells that are not specific to antigens within the tumor microenvironment. Conclusion: Non-specific T-cells could help reset the immunological deficiencies in body, which could translate to reduced incidence of tumor load.">

        <tr id="Aims/hypothesis Immunotherapeutics targeting T cells are crucial for inhibiting autoimmune disease progression proximal to disease onset in type 1 diabetes. A growing number of T cell-directed therapeutics have demonstrated partial therapeutic efficacy, with anti-CD3 (α-CD3) representing the only regulatory agency-approved drug capable of slowing disease progression through a mechanism involving the induction of partial T cell exhaustion. There is an outstanding need to augment the durability and effectiveness of T cell targeting by directly restraining proinflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) and type 1 cytotoxic CD8+ T cell (Tc1) subsets, while simultaneously augmenting regulatory T cell (Treg) activity. Here, we present a novel strategy for reducing diabetes incidence in the NOD mouse model using a blocking monoclonal antibody targeting the type 1 diabetes-risk associated T cell co-stimulatory receptor, CD226. Methods Female NOD mice were treated with anti-CD226 between 7-8 weeks of age and then monitored for diabetes incidence and therapeutic mechanism of action. Results Compared to isotype-treated controls, anti-CD226 treated NOD mice showed reduced insulitis severity at 12 weeks and decreased disease incidence at 30 weeks. Flow cytometric analysis performed five weeks post-treatment demonstrated reduced proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells in spleens of anti-CD226 treated mice. Phenotyping of pancreatic Tregs revealed increased CD25 expression and STAT5 phosphorylation following anti-CD226, with splenic Tregs displaying augmented suppression of CD4+ T cell responders in vitro. Anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited reduced frequencies of islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit related protein (IGRP)-reactive CD8+ T cells in the pancreas, using both ex vivo tetramer staining and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) approaches. 51Cr-release assays demonstrated reduced cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells by anti-CD226-treated autoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Conclusions/interpretation CD226 blockade reduces T cell cytotoxicity and improves Treg function, representing a targeted and rational approach for restoring immune regulation in type 1 diabetes. Research in Context What is already known about this subject? The co-stimulatory receptor CD226 is upregulated upon activation and is highly expressed on NK cell subsets, myeloid cells, and effector T cells. A single nucleotide polymorphism in CD226 (rs763361; C>T) results in a Gly307Ser missense mutation linked to genetic susceptibility for type 1 diabetes. Global knockout of Cd226 and conditional Cd226 knockout in FoxP3+ Tregs reduced insulitis severity and diabetes incidence in NOD mice, indicating a crucial role for CD226 in disease pathogenesis. What is the key question? Can CD226 blockade reduce T cell cytotoxicity and improve Treg function to diminish diabetes incidence in NOD mice? What are the new findings? Anti-CD226 treatment reduced insulitis, decreased disease incidence, and inhibited splenic CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cell proliferation. Pancreatic Tregs from anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited increased CD25 expression; splenic Tregs displayed augmented STAT5 phosphorylation and suppressive capacity in vitro. Anti-CD226 treatment reduced IGRP-specific pancreatic CD8+ T cell frequencies, and reduced autoreactive CD8+ T cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells in vitro. How might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future? CD226 blockade could reduce autoreactive T cell cytotoxicity, enhance Treg function, and slow disease progression in high-risk or recent-onset type 1 diabetes cases.">

        <tr id="Concurrent KRAS LKB1 (STK11, KL) mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC) is particularly difficult to treat and does not respond well to current immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. This is due to numerous mechanisms including low antigen presentation limiting T cell mediated killing. To activate anti-tumor immunity, we targeted tumor cell – natural killer (NK) cell interactions. We tested whether a novel antibody based therapeutic strategy that predominantly activates natural killer (NK) cells demonstrates efficacy in pre-clinical mouse models of KL NSCLC. NK cells rely on binding of ligands, such as Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I-related chain A or B (MICA/B), to the activating receptor NKG2D. Importantly MICA and MICB are widely expressed in elevated levels across NSCLC subtypes including KL lung cancers. Proteases with the tumor microenvironment (TME) can cleave these proteins rendering tumor cells less visible to NK cells. We therefore developed a MICA monoclonal antibody, AHA-1031, which utilizes two NK cell activating receptors. AHA1031 prevents ligand shedding without interfering with binding to NKG2D while targeting cancer cells to antibody mediated cell dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). Our therapeutic novel antibody has significant monotherapy activity in KL cancer models including xenografts of human cell lines and patient derived xenografts. Activating NK cells through MICA/B stabilization and inducing ADCC offers an alternative and potent therapy option in KL tumors. MICA/B are shed across different tumors making this therapeutic strategy universally applicable.">

        <tr id="Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a plasma cell disorder distinguished from multiple myeloma (MM) by the degree of organ involvement due to tissue deposition of misfolded proteins. Treatments for AL amyloidosis have largely been borrowed from those developed for patients with MM. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has historically been associated with the best outcomes. The recent incorporation of daratumumab into up front therapy represents a significant advance and has changed the treatment paradigm, calling into question the role of ASCT. The development of very active novel immune and cellular therapies, specifically B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed therapies, has similarly been transformative for patients with MM and is now being studied in patients with AL amyloidosis. These include chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, bispecific antibodies, and antibody drug conjugates. Although limited, preliminary data in patients with relapsed and refractory AL amyloidosis are showing promising results, and it is expected that the treatment landscape for AL amyloidosis will continue to evolve. Particular attention to safety, potential for organ recovery, and quality of life will be important when evaluating new treatments and/or treatment paradigms.">

These conditions are primarily characterized by an immoderate activation of the immune system or deviant immune responses, involving diverse immune components including immune cells, antibodies, and inflammatory mediators. However, the precise molecular dysregulation underlying numerous individual cases of these diseases and unique subsets respond under disease conditions remains elusive. Comprehending the mechanisms and determinants governing the homeostasis and functionality of diseases could offer potential therapeutic opportunities for intervention. Mass cytometry enables precise and high-throughput quantitative measurement of proteins within individual cells by utilizing antibodies labeled with rare heavy metal isotopes. Imaging mass cytometry employs mass spectrometry to obtain spatial information on cell-to-cell interactions within tissue sections, simultaneously utilizing more than 40 markers. The application of single-cell mass cytometry presents a unique opportunity to conduct highly multiplexed analysis at the single-cell level, thereby revolutionizing our understanding of cell population heterogeneity and hierarchy, cellular states, multiplexed signaling pathways, proteolysis products, and mRNA transcripts specifically in the context of many autoimmune diseases. This information holds the potential to offer novel approaches for the diagnosis, prognostic assessment, and monitoring responses to treatment, thereby enriching our strategies in managing the respective conditions. This review summarizes the present-day utilization of single-cell mass cytometry in studying immune-related skin diseases, highlighting its advantages and limitations. This technique will become increasingly prevalent in conducting extensive investigations into these disorders, ultimately yielding significant contributions to their accurate diagnosis and efficacious therapeutic interventions.">

Despite the eye's immune-privileged status, some patients display inflammatory events requiring the use of corticoids as an adjunct treatment which led us to question the immune consequences of a subretinal AAV administration. We first characterized anti-transgene immune responses induced in the periphery by injecting increasing doses of AAV8 encoding reporter proteins fused with the HY male antigen into the subretinal space of female C57BL/6 and rd10 mice. Transgene expression was monitored over time with bioluminescence imaging and T-cell immune responses in the spleen were analyzed by IFNγ ELISpot and cytokine multiplex assays. Our data show that AAV8 injections cause proinflammatory T-cell immune response against the transgene product, correlated with the transgene expression level at 2.109 vg and above. Additionally, co-injection of immunodominant peptides from the transgene product, along with AAV8, modulates the immune response at all AAV doses tested. Taken together, our data suggest that injection of AAV8 in the subretinal space induces proinflammatory peripheral T-cell responses to the transgene product that can be modulated by the subretinal associated immune inhibition (SRAII) mechanism.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Patients with B-cell lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who receive chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy may experience clinically significant cytomegalovirus infection (CS-CMVi). However, risk factors for CS-CMVi are not well defined. The aims of our study were to identify risk factors for CS-CMVi and the association between CS-CMVi and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in lymphoma and ALL patients after CAR-T therapy. Methods We performed a retrospective single-center cohort analysis of CAR-T recipients between January 2018 and February 2021 for treatment of lymphoma and ALL. We collected data on demographics, oncologic history, CAR-T therapy–related complications, and infectious complications within 1 year of therapy. Results Of 230 patients identified, 22 (10%) had CS-CMVi. At 1 year following CAR-T therapy, 75 patients (33%) developed relapsed disease and 95 (41%) died; NRM at 1 year was 37%. On Cox regression analysis, Asian or Middle Eastern race (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 13.71 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 5.41–34.74]), treatment of cytokine release syndrome/immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome with steroids (aHR, 6.25 [95% CI, 1.82–21.47]), lactate dehydrogenase at time of CAR-T therapy (aHR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.02–1.16]), and CMV surveillance (aHR, 6.91 [95% CI, 2.77–17.25]) were independently associated with CS-CMVi. CS-CMVi was independently associated with NRM at 1 year after CAR-T therapy (odds ratio, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.29–4.82]). Conclusions Further studies of immunologic correlatives and clinical trials to determine the efficacy of prophylactic strategies are needed to understand the role of CS-CMVi and post–CAR-T mortality.">

        <tr id="Recent years have seen a marked increase in research on chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells, with specific relevance to the treatment of hematological malignancies. Here, the structural principles, iterative processes, and target selection of CAR-T cells for therapeutic applications are described in detail, as well as the challenges faced in the treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. These challenges include insufficient infiltration of cells, off-target effects, cytokine release syndrome, and tumor lysis syndrome. In addition, directions in the iterative development of CAR-T cell therapy are discussed, including modifications of CAR-T cell structures, improvements in specificity using multi-targets and novel targets, the use of Boolean logic gates to minimize off-target effects and control toxicity, and the adoption of additional protection mechanisms to improve the durability of CAR-T cell treatment. This review provides ideas and strategies for the development of CAR-T cell therapy through an in-depth exploration of the underlying mechanisms of action of CAR-T cells and their potential for innovative modification.">

 Most Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHLs) originate from germinal center (GC) or post-GCB cells. While the immune system actively targets precancerous cells in epithelial-derived cancers, it is uncertain if the same applies to precancerous GCB cells. Knowledge on Follicular Lymphoma (FL), the most common low-grade NHL derived from GCB cells, prompted us to develop novel mouse models to mimic the precancerous state. In FL, BCL2 translocation and CREBBP loss-of-function (LoF) mutations are characteristic of a precancerous state. These mutations can be detected years before FL diagnosis, hinting at potential immune involvement in preventing FL. Our research affirms the effectiveness of the mouse models in replicating the FL precancerous state. Mice with BCL2 overexpression (OE) alone or together with CREBBP LoF showed increased GCB cell expansion, up to 6-fold compared to control. This expansion involved reduced GCB cell death rather than increased proliferation, consistent with FL slow-growing nature. Mice harboring mutant GCB cells also exhibited a significant increase in memory B cells, up to 20-fold when compared to control. As the GC reaction progressed, the impact of CREBBP LoF emerged, profoundly altering GCB cell phenotypes, and triggering a remarkable surge in cell expansion, escalating up to 80-fold compared to mice with BCL2 OE alone or control. However, this hyperplasia was swiftly followed by a decline, indicative of immunosurveillance targeting precancerous GCB cells. Prior to the reduction of GCB cells with BCL2 OE and CREBBP LoF, we observed a notable expansion of PD1+ CD8+ T cells expressing granzyme A and perforin. These activated CD8+ T cells also expressed CXCR5, facilitating their infiltrating into the B cell follicle to specifically eliminate GCB cells with BCL2 OE and CREBBP LoF. Preemptive depletion of CD8+ T cell effectively prevented the loss of precancerous GCB cells. The examination of the GC reaction over time provided new perspectives into the immunosurveillance of precancerous GCB cells and FL development. The data supports the concept that precancerous GCB cells must overcome robust anti-tumor immunity for Lymphoma to ensue. This knowledge offers potential explanation for the infrequent and extended duration of the transition from precancerous GCB cells to full-blown FL. These models provide a foundation to explore mechanisms underlying immune evasion by precancerous GCB cells.

The unprecedented rates of deep and long-lasting remissions have been meanwhile confirmed in multiple real-world analyses and more recently, the KarMMa-3 and CARTITUDE-4 studies lead to the approval in earlier lines of therapy. It is currently believed that ultimately all patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma experience relapse after anti-BCMA CAR T-cell therapies. There is a plethora of CAR T-cell therapies targeting novel antigens, with the aim to overcome current CAR T-cell resistance. In this review, we will summarize current evidence of novel antigens and their clinical potential. Together with current CAR T-cell therapy and T-cell engagers, these approaches might lead us to the next frontier in multiple myeloma: total immunotherapy and the road to chemotherapy-free cure.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory neuropathies, which include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS), result from autoimmune destruction of the PNS and are characterized by progressive weakness and sensory loss. CD4+ T cells play a key role in the autoimmune destruction of the PNS. Yet, key properties of pathogenic CD4+ T cells remain incompletely understood. Here, we used paired single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) and single-cell T cell receptor–sequencing (scTCR-Seq) of peripheral nerves from an inflammatory neuropathy mouse model to identify IL-21–expressing CD4+ T cells that were clonally expanded and multifunctional. These IL-21–expressing CD4+ T cells consisted of 2 transcriptionally distinct expanded cell populations, which expressed genes associated with T follicular helper (Tfh) and T peripheral helper (Tph) cell subsets. Remarkably, TCR clonotypes were shared between these 2 IL-21–expressing cell populations, suggesting a common lineage differentiation pathway. Finally, we demonstrated that IL-21 receptor–KO (IL-21R–KO) mice were protected from neuropathy development and had decreased immune infiltration into peripheral nerves. IL-21 signaling upregulated CXCR6, a chemokine receptor that promotes CD4+ T cell localization in peripheral nerves. Together, these findings point to IL-21 signaling, Tfh/Tph differentiation, and CXCR6-mediated cellular localization as potential therapeutic targets in inflammatory neuropathies.">

        <tr id="Type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling has been shown to be upregulated in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Dysregulated B-cell functions, including antigen presentation, as well as antibody and cytokine production, all of which may be affected by IFN-I signaling, play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. We investigated the IFN-I signature in 71 patients with the more severe form of the disease, diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc), and 33 healthy controls (HCs). Activation via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can influence the IFN-I signaling cascade; thus, we analyzed the effects of the TLR homologue CD180 ligation on the IFN-I signature in B cells. CD180 stimulation augmented the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) in dcSSc B cells (p = 0.0123). The expression of IFN-I receptor (IFNAR1) in non-switched memory B cells producing natural autoantibodies was elevated in dcSSc (p = 0.0109), which was enhanced following anti-CD180 antibody treatment (p = 0.0125). Autoantibodies to IFN-Is (IFN-alpha and omega) correlated (dcSSc p = 0.0003, HC p = 0.0192) and were present at similar levels in B cells from dcSSc and HC, suggesting their regulatory role as natural autoantibodies. It can be concluded that factors other than IFN-alpha may contribute to the elevated IFN-I signature of dcSSc B cells, and one possible candidate is B-cell activation via CD180.">

        <tr id="Background Despite continuous improvements in the new target and construction of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T, relapse remains a significant challenge following CAR-T therapy. Tumor microenvironment (TME) strongly correlates with the efficacy of CAR-T therapy. V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA), which exerts a multifaceted and controversial role in regulating the TME, acts not only as a ligand on antigen-presenting cells but also functions as a receptor on T cells. However, the characteristics and underlying mechanisms governing endogenous T-cell activation by VISTA, which are pivotal for reshaping the TME, remain incompletely elucidated. Methods The immunocompetent B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), lymphoma, and melanoma murine models were employed to investigate the characteristics of endogenous T cells within the TME following CD19 and hCAIX CAR-T cell therapy, respectively. Furthermore, we examined the role of VISTA controlled by interferon (IFN)-γ signaling in regulating endogenous T-cell activation and functionality in B-ALL mice. Results We demonstrated that the administration of CD19 CAR-T or hCAIX CAR-T cell therapy elicited augmented immune responses of endogenous T cells within the TME of B-ALL, lymphoma, and melanoma mice, thereby substantiating the efficacy of CAR-T cell efficacy. However, in the TME lacking IFN-γ signaling, VISTA levels remained elevated, resulting in attenuated cytotoxicity of endogenous T cells and reduced B-ALL recipient survival. Mice treated with CD19 CAR-T cells exhibited increased proportions of endogenous memory T cells during prolonged remission, which possessed the tumor-responsive capabilities to protect against B-ALL re-challenge. Compared with wild-type (WT) CAR-T treated mice, the administration of IFN-γ−/− CAR-T to both WT and IFN-γ−/− recipients resulted in a reduction in the numbers of endogenous CD4+ and CD8+ effectors, while exhibiting increased populations of naïve-like CD4+ T and memory CD8+ T cells. VISTA expression consistently remained elevated in resting or memory CD4+ T cells, with distinct localization from programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) expressing T subsets. Blocking the VISTA signal enhanced dendritic cell-induced proliferation and cytokine production by syngeneic T cells. Conclusion Our findings confirm that endogenous T-cell activation and functionality are regulated by VISTA, which is associated with the therapeutic efficiency of CAR-T and provides a promising therapeutic strategy for relapse cases in CAR-T therapy.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy. In the context of the current standard of care therapies in Canada, outcomes among patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), particularly those with triple-class (or more) refractory disease remain poor. Immunotherapies have significantly changed the treatment landscape of MM. Since 2021, two BCMA-targeting CAR T-cell therapy products have been approved for RRMM—namely Idecabtagene vicleucel (Ide-cel) (ABECMA®) and Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Cilta-cel) (CARVYKTI®), both of which are available in the US and Europe. Although they have shown unprecedented efficacy in RRMM, their clinical and logistical limitations must be acknowledged. MM CAR T-cell therapy is likely to be approved in Canada soon. Therefore, it is timely that we review the latest evidence for commercially available CAR T-cell therapy in multiple myeloma, with a focus on its relevance and impact in the Canadian setting. There will be challenges to access and strategies must be in place to ensure equitable care for all Canadians with MM.

 Introduction: Epcoritamab, a CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody, demonstrated deep and durable clinical responses in patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We evaluated the correlation of peripheral blood (PB) and tumor tissue biomarkers with clinical response to epcoritamab.
 Methods: Pts received priming (0.16 mg), intermediate (0.8 mg) and full epcoritamab doses (48 mg). Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was analyzed locally. Blood immunophenotyping was assessed by flow cytometry, plasma cytokines by MSD assay, and %CD20+ in tumors by immunohistochemistry (n=117). Gene expression in baseline tumor biopsies was evaluated using HTG EdgeSeq (n=70). Microenvironment scores were estimated from gene expression as a sum of immune (B/T, NK, dendritic, and myeloid cells) and stromal scores (adipocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells). Best overall response as of April 21, 2023 was assessed by independent review committee using Lugano criteria. P values were based on Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
 Results: In PB at baseline, significantly higher ALC (P=0.031), CD4+ (P=0.0038), and CD8+ (P=0.043) T-cell levels were observed in responders (R) vs nonresponders (NR). Similarly, CD4+ (P=0.02) and CD8+ (P=0.03) signatures and immune and microenvironment scores were higher in baseline tumor tissue in R vs NR. In PB CD8+ T cells, NR showed higher %PD1+ (P=0.016), %TIM3+ (P=0.048), and %TIM3+TIGIT+ (P=0.045). High tumor %CD20+ (≥90%) was observed in most pts (n=97/117); lower %CD20+ (<50%) was observed only in 6 NRs and 1 R. Epcoritamab treatment caused a rapid decline in circulating B cells irrespective of clinical response. Transient reductions in PB CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (ie, margination) were observed within 24 hours (H) after each dose during cycle (C) 1 and were more pronounced in R vs NR. Magnitude of margination for CD8+ T cells after the priming and intermediate doses was significantly lower in NR (reduced by median 22 & 41%) vs R (57 & 70%), while the difference in CD4+ T cells was not as pronounced in NR vs R, resulting in a substantially lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio in NR vs R. In C1, epcoritamab led to an increase of PB CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing activation/proliferation markers, with significantly higher fold change from baseline in R vs NR, especially within 24H post-priming dose. Early cytokine peaks of IFNy and IL-10 were more pronounced 6–24H post-priming dose and 6–14H post-first full dose in complete R vs pts with progressive disease. Epcoritamab also appeared to modulate NK cell numbers (under further investigation).
 Conclusions: In pts with R/R DLBCL, T-cell abundance and increased margination, activation, proliferation, and modulation of cytokines differed in R vs NR. These findings are consistent with epcoritamab’s mechanism of action and demonstrate the dependency on proper T-cell engagement for clinical benefit. Our findings also revealed differences in the dynamics of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell margination in R vs NR, warranting further investigation. Previously submitted in part to EHA 2024.

        <tr id="Background CD38 and CD47 are expressed in many hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM), B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Here, we evaluated the antitumor activities of CD38/CD47 bispecific antibodies (BsAbs). Methods Five suitable anti-CD38 antibodies for co-targeting CD47 and CD38 BsAb were developed using a 2 + 2 “mAb-trap” platform. The activity characteristics of the CD38/CD47 BsAbs were evaluated using in vitro and in vivo systems. Results Using hybridoma screening technology, we obtained nine suitable anti-CD38 antibodies. All anti-CD38 antibodies bind to CD38+ tumor cells and kill tumor cells via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Five anti-CD38 antibodies (4A8, 12C10, 26B4, 35G5, and 65A7) were selected for designing CD38/CD47 BsAbs (IMM5605) using a “mAb-trap” platform. BsAbs had higher affinity and binding activity to the CD38 target than those to the CD47 target, decreasing the potential on-target potential and off-tumor effects. The CD38/CD47 BsAbs did not bind to RBCs and did not induce RBC agglutination; thus, BsAbs had much lower blood toxicity. The CD38/CD47 BsAbs had a greater ability to block the CD47/SIRPα signal in CD38+/CD47+ tumor cells than IMM01 (SIRPα Fc fusion protein). Through Fc domain engineering, CD38/CD47 BsAbs were shown to kill tumors more effectively by inducing ADCC and ADCP. IMM5605–26B4 had the strongest inhibitory effect on cellular CD38 enzymatic activity. IMM5605–12C10 had the strongest ability to directly induce the apoptosis of tumor cells. The anti-CD38 antibody 26B4 combined with the SIRPα-Fc fusion proteins showed strong antitumor effects, which were better than any of the mono-therapeutic agents used alone in the NCI-H929 cell xenograft model. The CD38/CD47 BsAbs exhibited strong antitumor effects; specifically, IMM5605–12C10 efficiently eradicated all established tumors in all mice. Conclusion A panel of BsAbs targeting CD38 and CD47 developed based on the “mAb-tarp” platform showed potent tumor-killing ability in vitro and in vivo. As BsAbs had lower affinity for binding to CD47, higher affinity for binding to CD38, no affinity for binding to RBCs, and did not induce RBC agglutination, we concluded that CD38/CD47 BsAbs are safe and have a satisfactory tolerability profile.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
To investigate the remodeling of multiple myeloma (MM) microenvironment after BCMA-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on paired bone marrow specimens (n = 14) from 7 MM patients before (i.e., baseline, 'day -4') and after (i.e., 'day 28') post-lymphodepleted BCMA CAR-T therapy.


RESULTS
Our analysis revealed heterogeneity in gene expression profiles among MM cells, even those harboring the same cytogenetic abnormalities. The best overall responses (BORs) of patients over the 15-month follow-up are positively correlated with the abundance and targeted cytotoxic activity of CD8+ effector CAR-T cells on day 28 after CAR-T cell infusion. Additionally, favorable responses are associated with attenuated immunosuppression mediated by regulatory T cells (Tregs), enhanced CD8+ effector T cell cytotoxic activity, and elevated type 1 conventional dendritic cell (cDC1) antigen presentation ability. DC re-clustering inferred intramedullary-originated cDC3s with extramedullary migration. Cell-cell communication network analysis indicated BCMA CAR-T therapy mitigates BAFF/GALECTIN/MK pathway-mediated immunosuppression and activates MIF pathway-mediated anti-MM immunity.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study sheds light on MM microenvironment dynamics after BCMA CAR-T therapy, offering clues for predicting treatment responsivity.">

        <tr id="Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is an extremely rare hematological malignancy with a highly aggressive behavior and median survival of <2 years. Especially, most BPDCN patients present with extensive and non-specific skin lesions, usually leading to misdiagnosis as a skin disease and delay therapy. As for treatment, most patients with BPDCN experience relapse shortly after treatment with the traditional regimens. The alleviation of skin symptoms reflects the effects of clinical treatments. Herein, we report a case of a 71-year-old man with intermittent and gradually expanding skin lesions over his chest, abdomen, and back for 1 year. On admission, physical examination revealed extensive skin lesions and multiple enlarged lymph nodes. Laboratory examinations showed pancytopenia and numerous malignant cells in the peripheral blood smear (60%), bone marrow aspirate smear (73.5%). Immunophenotyping using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry presented large numbers of BPDCN cells in the bone marrow, cervical lymph nodes and dermal tissue. PET/CT revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes and splenomegaly. Once the diagnosis was identified as BPDCN, the patient began treatment with the oral BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax and subcutaneously administered azacitidine. After the first course, skin lesions reduced markedly and complete remission was achieved in the bone marrow. Our study and current cumulative data according to reviewing systematically suggest that venetoclax combined with azacitidine is safe, effective, and applicable in the treatment of BPDCN, especially for elderly relapsed/refractory patients. This study, therefore, significantly contributes to the literature on the current and future treatment for BPDCN.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has made significant strides in cancer treatment with strategies like checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfer. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) have emerged as a promising approach to combine these strategies and overcome their limitations. This review explores CAR-T cells as a living drug for cancer treatment. CAR-T cells are genetically engineered immune cells designed to target and eliminate tumor cells by recognizing specific antigens. The study involves a comprehensive literature review on CAR-T cell technology, covering structure optimization, generations, manufacturing processes, and gene therapy strategies. It examines CAR-T therapy in haematologic cancers and solid tumors, highlighting challenges and proposing a suicide gene-based mechanism to enhance safety. The results show significant advancements in CAR-T technology, particularly in structure optimization and generation. The manufacturing process has improved for broader clinical application. However, a series of inherent challenges and side effects still need to be addressed. In conclusion, CAR-T cells hold great promise for cancer treatment, but ongoing research is crucial to improve efficacy and safety for oncology patients. The proposed suicide gene-based mechanism offers a potential solution to mitigate side effects including cytokine release syndrome (the most common toxic side effect of CAR-T therapy) and the associated neurotoxicity.">

        <tr id="Astaxanthin (ASX) is an oxygen-containing non-vitamin A carotenoid pigment. However, the role of ASX in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) remains unclear. In this study, a mouse model of AIH is established induced by concanavalin A (ConA). Mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are used to analyze the potential role of ASX in regulating the immune microenvironment of AIH. ASX treatment effectively alleviated liver damage induced by ConA and downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines production in mice. Mass cytometry and scRNA-seq analyses revealed a significant increase in the number of CD8+ T cells following ASX treatment. Functional markers of CD8+ T cells, such as CD69, MHC II, and PD-1, are significantly downregulated. Additionally, specific CD8+ T cell subclusters (subclusters 4, 13, 24, and 27) are identified, each displaying distinct changes in marker gene expression after ASX treatment. This finding suggests a modulation of CD8+ T cell function by ASX. Finally, the key transcription factors for four subclusters of CD8+ T cells are predicted and constructed a cell-to-cell communication network based on receptor-ligand interactions probability. In conclusion, ASX holds the potential to ameliorate liver damage by regulating the number and function of CD8+ T cells.">

We attempt to analyze bone marrow findings and correlation with cytopenia(s) after anti-B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell infusion in this study.


METHODS
Relevant clinicopathologic data, including complete blood counts, neutrophil counts, relevant therapy history, and pre- and posttherapy bone marrow evaluations, were studied in 12 patients who received anti-BCMA CAR T-cell therapy.


RESULTS
Bone marrow findings after CAR T-cell therapy were available in 6 of 12 cases, 3 of which showed markedly hypocellular marrow with either markedly reduced or essentially absent hematopoiesis. One case showed a hypocellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis, while the remaining 2 cases showed persistent involvement by plasma cell myeloma. Reticulin stains did not reveal significant fibrosis. Ten patients had anemia, and 8 patients had leukopenia and thrombocytopenia at day 90 posttherapy. Long-term follow-up showed persistent disease in 10 of 12 cases.


CONCLUSIONS
Prolonged cytopenias occur in most patients after BCMA CAR T-cell therapy with bone marrow evaluations demonstrating associated marked hypocellularity with minimal or no hematopoiesis without an increase in fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Background The short-term complications from chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CART) are well characterized, but the long-term complications still need to be further investigated. Therefore, herein, we will review the currently available literature published on the late adverse events following CART. Methods We reviewed published data available from pivotal trials and real-world experiences with anti-CD19 CART (CART19) for adults with lymphoma. We defined late events as occurring or persisting beyond 1 month after CART infusion. We focused our literature review on the following late-event outcomes post-CART19: cytopenia, immune reconstitution, infections, and subsequent malignancies. Results Grade 3–4 cytopenia beyond 30 days occurs in 30%–40% of patients and beyond 90 days in 3%–22% of patients and is usually managed with growth-factor and transfusion support, along with neutropenic prophylaxis. B-cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia are expected on-target off-tumor effects of CART19, 44%–53% of patients have IgG < 400 mg/dL, and approximately 27%–38% of patients receive intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement. Infections beyond the initial month from CART19 are not frequent and rarely severe, but they are more prevalent and severe when patients receive subsequent therapies post-CART19 for their underlying disease. Late neurotoxicity and neurocognitive impairment are uncommon, and other causes should be considered. T-cell lymphoma (TCL) after CART is an extremely rare event and not necessarily related to CAR transgene. Myeloid neoplasm is not rare post-CART, but unclear causality given heavily pretreated patient population is already at risk for therapy-related myeloid neoplasm. Conclusion CART19 is associated with clinically significant long-term effects such as prolonged cytopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and infections that warrant clinical surveillance, but they are mostly manageable with a low risk of non-relapse mortality. The risk of subsequent malignancies post-CART19 seems low, and the relationship with CART19 and/or prior therapies is unclear; but regardless of the possible causality, this should not impact the current benefit–risk ratio of CART19 for relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).">

        <tr id="Multiple chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies are FDA approved, and several are under development. While effective for some cancers, toxicities remain a limitation. The most common toxicities, i.e. cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), are well described. With increasing utilization, providers worldwide are reporting on other emergent, and often complicated toxicities. Given the evolving toxicity profiles and urgent need to catalogue these emerging and emergent CAR T toxicities and describe management approaches, the American Society of Hematology Subcommittee on Emerging Gene and Cell Therapies organized the first Scientific Workshop on CAR T cell toxicities during the annual society meeting. The workshop functioned to 1) aggregate reports of CAR T emergent toxicities, including movement disorders after BCMA CAR T, coagulation abnormalities, and prolonged cytopenias; 2) disseminate bedside to bench efforts elucidating pathophysiological mechanisms of CAR-T toxicities, including the intestinal microbiota and systemic immune dysregulation; and 3) highlight gaps in the availability of clinical tests such as cytokine measurements, which could be utilized to expand our knowledge around the monitoring of toxicities. Key themes emerged. First, while clinical manifestations may develop before the pathophysiologic mechanisms are understood, these must be studied to aid in the detection and prevention of such toxicities. Second, systemic immune dysregulation appears central to these emergent toxicities and research is needed to elucidate links between tumor, CAR T, and microbiota. Finally, there was consensus around an urgency to create a repository to capture emergent CAR-T toxicities and the real-world management.">

        <tr id="Importance
Patients with high-risk newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) often have poor outcomes with standard treatments, necessitating novel effective frontline therapies to enhance clinical outcomes. GC012F, a B-cell maturation antigen/CD19 dual-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, has been developed on the novel FasTCAR platform. Notably, its use as a frontline therapy for patients with high-risk NDMM who are eligible for transplant has not been thoroughly explored.


Objective
To examine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and patient health and survival outcomes associated with GC012F in individuals with NDMM.


Design, Setting, and Participants
Patients were enrolled in this single-arm, open-label phase 1 cohort study between June 28, 2021, and June 1, 2023 (the data cutoff date). All patients included in this study were treated at a single center, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital. The patients in the efficacy evaluation were followed up for a minimum period of 3 months.


Intervention
Patients underwent 2 cycles of induction therapy, followed by GC012F infusion (at 1 × 105 cells/kg, 2 × 105 cells/kg, or 3 × 105 cells/kg).


Main Outcomes and Measures
The primary goals were to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of GC012F at various dose levels.


Results
Of 22 patients receiving GC012F treatment, 6 experienced mild to moderate cytokine release syndrome (grade 1-2) and none experienced neurotoxic effects. Nineteen patients were included in the efficacy evaluation, and all 19 patients showed stringent complete responses and achieved minimal residual disease negativity. The treatment's effectiveness was consistent across different dose levels. GC012F demonstrated a rapid response, with a median time to first stringent complete response of 84 days (range, 26-267 days) and achieving minimal residual disease negativity within 28 days (range, 23-135 days). The CAR T-cell expansion was robust, with a median peak copy number of 60 652 copies/μg genomic DNA (range, 8754-331 159 copies/μg genomic DNA), and the median time to median peak copy number was 10 days (range, 9-14 days).


Conclusions and Relevance
The findings of this single-arm, open-label phase 1 cohort study suggest that GC012F may be a safe treatment associated with positive health and survival outcomes for patients with high-risk NDMM eligible for transplant. Owing to the small sample size, further studies with larger cohorts and longer follow-up durations are needed.">

        <tr id="Abstract Sipuleucel-T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy that targets prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and is available for treatment of men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In this single-arm, two-cohort, multicenter clinical study, potential racial differences in immune responses to sipuleucel-T in men with mCRPC were explored. Patients’ blood samples were obtained to assess serum cytokines, humoral responses, and cellular immunity markers before and after treatment. Baseline cumulative product parameters (total nucleated and CD54+ cell counts and CD54 upregulation) were evaluated. IgM titers against the immunogen PA2024, the target antigen PAP, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were quantified by ELISA. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity was determined by ELISpots, and cytokine and chemokine concentrations were determined by Luminex.Twenty-nine African American (AA) men and 28 non-African American (non-AA) men with mCRPC received sipuleucel-T. Baseline total nucleated cell count, CD54+ cell count, CD54 expression, and cumulative product parameters were higher in non-AA men. Although PSA baseline levels were higher in AA men, there were no racial differences in IgM antibody and IFNγ ELISpots responses against PA2024, PAP, PSA, and PSMA before and after treatment. Expression of co-stimulatory receptor ICOS on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and the levels of Th1 cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and chemokines CCL4 and CCL5, were significantly higher in AA men before and/or after treatment. Despite no difference in the overall survival, PSA changes from baseline were significantly different between the two races. The data suggest that immune correlates in blood differ in AA and non-AA men with mCRPC pre- and post-sipuleucel-T. Significance: Our novel findings of higher expression of co-stimulatory receptor ICOS on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in African American patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) prior and post-sipuleucel-T suggest activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The data indicate that racial differences observed in these and other immune correlates before and after sipuleucel-T warrant additional investigation to further our understanding of the immune system in African American men and other men with mCRPC.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown remarkable efficacy in cancer treatment. Still, most patients receiving CAR T cells relapse within 5 years of treatment. CAR-mediated trogocytosis (CMT) is a potential tumor escape mechanism in which cell surface proteins transfer from tumor cells to CAR T cells. CMT results in the emergence of antigen-negative tumor cells, which can evade future CAR detection, and antigen-positive CAR T cells, which is hypothesized to lead to CAR T cell fratricide and dysfunction. Using a system to selectively degrade trogocytosed antigen in CAR T cells, we show that the presence of trogocytosed antigen in CAR T cells directly causes CAR T cell fratricide and exhaustion. By performing a small molecule screening using a custom high throughput CMT-screening assay, we identified the cysteine protease cathepsin B (CTSB) as a key driver of CMT. We show that overexpression of cystatin A (CSTA), an endogenous human inhibitor of CTSB, reduces trogocytosis resulting in prolonged antitumor activity and increased CAR T cell expansion/persistence. Overall, we show that targeting CMT is an effective approach to enhance CAR T cell function, which may improve their clinical efficacy. One sentence summary CAR-mediated trogocytosis directly causes CAR T cell exhaustion and fratricide but can be prevented by inhibiting the cysteine protease cathepsin B through overexpression of human cystatins.">

Here, we explored LN-associated histological, immunological, and virological mechanisms of bNAb generation in a cohort of anti-retroviral therapy (ART)-naïve PLWH. We found that participants who produce bNAbs, termed neutralizers, have a superior LN-associated B cell follicle architecture compared with PLWH who do not. The latter was associated with a significantly higher in situ prevalence of Bcl-6hi follicular helper CD4 T cells (TFH), expressing a molecular program that favors their differentiation and stemness, and significantly reduced IL-10 follicular suppressor CD4 T cells. Furthermore, our data reveal possible molecular targets mediating TFH-B cell interactions in neutralizers.

        <tr id="Background Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapies have achieved remarkable success in the treatment of hematological tumors. However, given the distinct features of solid tumors, particularly heterogeneity, metabolic aggressiveness, and fewer immune cells in tumor microenvironment (TME), the practical utility of CAR-T cells for solid tumors remains as a challenging issue. Meanwhile, although anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) has shown clinical efficacy, most mAbs also show limited clinical benefits for solid tumors due mainly to the issues associated with the lack of immune cells in TME. Thus, the infiltration of targeted immunological active cells into TME could generate synergistic efficacy for mAbs. Methods We present a combinational strategy for solid tumor treatment, which combines armored-T cells to express Fc-gamma receptor I (FcγRI) fragment on the surfaces for targeting various tumors with therapeutically useful mAbs. Choosing CD20 and HER-2 as the targets, we characterized the in vitro and in vivo efficacy and latent mechanism of the combination drug by using flow cytometry, ELISA and other methods. Results The combination and preprocessing of armored T-cells with corresponding antibody of Rituximab and Pertuzumab exerted profound anti-tumor effects, which is demonstrated to be mediated by synergistically produced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effects. Meanwhile, mAb was able to carry armored-T cell by preprocessing for the infiltration to TME in cell derived xenograft (CDX) model. Conclusions This combination strategy showed a significant increase of safety profiles from the reduction of antibody doses. More importantly, the present strategy could be a versatile tool for a broad spectrum of cancer treatment, with a simple pairing of engineered T cells and a conventional antibody.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells that are obtained from the specific patient, modified genetically ex vivo, and possess the remarkable capability to identify and eradicate targeted cancer cells. These modified cells are subsequently reintroduced into the patient, effectively treating blood cancer. CAR-T therapy is approved to be applied in leukemia due to its great clinical therapeutic effect on B cell hematological malignancies. However, solid tumors are more resistant to this therapy for many reasons. The abnormal vascular structure of solid tumors hampers CAR-T cell trafficking. Various kinds of immunosuppressive cells and chemicals in the tumor microenvironment (TME) accelerates CAR-T cell exhaustion, showing poor persistence in vivo. More and more researches have demonstrated that T cell fate is strongly associated with epigenetic regulation. Epigenetic modification is not a direct addition or deletion of DNA, but a reversible method including modifications on DNA and histones, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-mediated regulations. The change of epigenetic landscape in CAR-T cells largely determines the therapeutic performance in vivo. This research outlines three major barriers in CAR-T therapy, including T cell exhaustion, differentiation and infiltration. Additionally, the research elucidates several promising epigenetic reprogramming strategies to reduce CAR-T cells exhaustion, modulate the cell differentiation process, and enhance their infiltration into solid tumors.">

        <tr id="The identification and targeting of B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) through immunotherapeutic strategies such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR T-cells), and T-cell engagers (TCE) have revolutionized the care of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). These treatment modalities have improved survival outcomes of relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) MM patients compared to previously established strategies and are moving into earlier lines of therapy (LOT). Despite their efficacy, the majority of patients eventually relapse, necessitating additional therapeutic targets for salvage. G-protein-coupled receptor class 5 member D (GPRC5D), Fc receptor-homolog 5 (FcRH5), and SLAMF7 are some examples of novel targets in development. This expanding armamentarium of immunotherapeutic agents will be crucial to address the unmet need for relapses following BCMA-targeting therapies, particularly antigen-negative relapses. The utilization of sequential T-cell redirective therapies including agents targeting different tumor-associated antigens and combination therapies appears feasible paves the way for effective chemotherapy-free regimes. Deliberate consideration of treatment timing, preserving T-cell health, overcoming antigenic loss, and comprehension of the complex tumor microenvironment would be key to maximizing therapeutic benefits and minimizing adverse effects. This review summarizes novel targets in development for myeloma beyond BCMA, presenting pivotal safety and efficacy data derived from clinical trials where available and the considerations vital for navigating this expanding landscape of immunotherapeutic options.">

        <tr id="Abstract Immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective first-line therapy for solid cancers. However, low response rate and acquired resistance over time has led to the need for additional therapeutic options. Here, we evaluated synergistic antitumor efficacy of EGFR × MET targeting bispecific antibody, amivantamab with PD-L1 immunotherapy, pembrolizumab in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma tumor–bearing humanized patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. We demonstrated that pembrolizumab or amivantamab alone was ineffective and that combination treatment induced a significant reduction of tumor growth in both models (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.01, respectively). It appeared that combination of amivantamab and pembrolizumab significantly enhanced infiltration of granzyme B–producing CD8 T cells was in the TME of HNSCC PDX (P < 0.01) and enhanced neoantigen-associated central memory CD8 T cells in circulating immune cells. Analysis of single-cell RNA transcriptomics suggested that the tumor cells dramatically upregulated EGFR and MET in response to PD-L1 immunotherapy, potentially creating a metabolic state fit for tumor persistence in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and rendered pembrolizumab ineffective. We demonstrated that EGFRHIGHMETHIGH subcluster displayed an increased expression of genes implicated in production of lactate [SLC16A3 and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA)] compared to the EGFRLOWMETLOW cluster. Accumulation of lactate in the TME has been associated with immunosuppression by hindering the infiltration of tumor killing CD8 T and NK cells. This study proved that amivantamab reduced glycolytic markers in the EGFRHIGHMETHIGH subcluster including SLC16A3 and LDHA and highlighted remodeling of the TME by combination treatment, providing rationale for additional therapy of amivantamab with PD-1 immunotherapy. Significance: Amivantamab in synergy with pembrolizumab effectively eradicated EGFRHIGHMETHIGH tumor subcluster in the tumor microenvironment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and overcame resistance against anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="A comprehensive immune landscape for Brucella infection is crucial for developing new treatments for brucellosis. Here, we utilized single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) of 290,369 cells from 35 individuals, including 29 brucellosis patients from acute (n = 10), sub‐acute (n = 9), and chronic (n = 10) phases as well as six healthy donors. Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays were applied for validation within this cohort. Brucella infection caused a significant change in the composition of peripheral immune cells and inflammation was a key feature of brucellosis. Acute patients are characterized by potential cytokine storms resulting from systemic upregulation of S100A8/A9, primarily due to classical monocytes. Cytokine storm may be mediated by activating S100A8/A9‐TLR4‐MyD88 signaling pathway. Moreover, monocytic myeloid‐derived suppressor cells were the probable contributors to immune paralysis in acute patients. Chronic patients are characterized by a dysregulated Th1 response, marked by reduced expression of IFN‐γ and Th1 signatures as well as a high exhausted state. Additionally, Brucella infection can suppress apoptosis in myeloid cells (e.g., mDCs, classical monocytes), inhibit antigen presentation in professional antigen‐presenting cells (APCs; e.g., mDC) and nonprofessional APCs (e.g., monocytes), and induce exhaustion in CD8+ T/NK cells, potentially resulting in the establishment of chronic infection. Overall, our study systemically deciphered the coordinated immune responses of Brucella at different phases of the infection, which facilitated a full understanding of the immunopathogenesis of brucellosis and may aid the development of new effective therapeutic strategies, especially for those with chronic infection.">

        <tr id="Our understanding of autoimmune diabetes underscores the critical involvement of CD8+ T cells recognizing islet-specific antigens. However, the influence of thymic positive selection on diabetogenic CD8+ T cell development remains unclear. Using CD5 marker representing T-cell receptor (TCR) signal strength, we illustrated that naïve CD5hiCD8+ T cells of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice with enhanced TCR signals displayed predisposed differentiated/memory T cell traits with increased activation and proliferation upon TCR stimulation, compared to CD5lo counterparts. Additionally, CD5hiCD8+ T cells exhibited gene expression landscape similar to effector T cells and exacerbated disease in transfer model. Interestingly, the protective effects of transgenic phosphatase Pep expression, which lowers TCR signaling and diabetes incidence, were abolished in NOD strain 8.3 with high CD5 expression linked to increased thymic positive selection. Strikingly, TCR repertoire analysis identified higher frequencies of autoimmune disease-related clonotypes in naïve CD5hiCD8+ cells, supporting that distinct effector functions arise from intrinsic TCR repertoire differences. Overall, CD5hiCD8+ clones may be potential targets for autoimmune diabetes treatment.">

        <tr id="Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of bacterial sexually transmitted infection in both men and women. Immunity to C. trachomatis involves many cell types, but CD4+ T cells play a key role in protecting the host during natural infection. Specifically, IFN-γ production by CD4+ T cells is the main effector responsible for bacterial clearance, yet the exact mechanism by which IFN-γ confers protection is poorly defined. In our efforts to define the specific mechanisms for bacterial clearance, we now show that IFN-γ upregulates expression of MHC class II (MHCII) on nonhematopoietic cells during C. trachomatis infection in vivo. We also find that MHCII expression on epithelial cells of the upper genital tract contributes to the efficient clearance of bacteria mediated by pathogen-specific CD4+ Th1 cells. As we further cataloged the protective mechanisms of C. trachomatis-specific CD4+ T cells, we found that the T cells also express granzyme B (GzmB) when coincubated with infected cells. In addition, during C. trachomatis infection of mice, primed activated-naive CD4+ Th1 cells displayed elevated granzyme transcripts (GzmA, GzmB, GzmM, GzmK, GzmC) compared with memory CD4+ T cells in vivo. Finally, using intracellular cytokine staining and a GzmB-/- mouse strain, we show that C. trachomatis-specific CD4+ Th1 cells express GzmB upon Ag stimulation, and that this correlates with Chlamydia clearance in vivo. Together these results have led us to conclude that Chlamydia-specific CD4+ Th1 cells develop cytotoxic capacity through engagement with nonhematopoietic MHCII, and this correlates to C. trachomatis clearance.">

        <tr id="HLA-B*27 was one of the first HLA alleles associated with an autoimmune disease, i.e., axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and acute anterior uveitis (B27AAU), which cause joint and eye inflammation, respectively. Gastrointestinal inflammation has been suggested as a trigger of axSpA. We recently identified a bacterial peptide (YeiH) that can be presented by HLA-B*27 to expanded public T cell receptors (TCRs) in the joint in axSpA and the eye in B27AAU. While YeiH is present in enteric microbiota and pathogens, additional evidence that pathogenic T cells in HLA-B*27-associated autoimmunity may have had a prior antigenic encounter within the gastrointestinal tract remains lacking. Here, we analyze ocular, synovial, and blood T cells in B27AAU and axSpA, showing that YeiH-specific CD8 T cells express a mucosal gene set and surface proteins consistent with intestinal differentiation, including CD161, integrin α4β7, and CCR6. In addition, we find an expansion of YeiH-specific CD8 T cells in the blood of axSpA and B27AAU over healthy controls, whereas influenza-specific CD8 T cells were equivalent across groups. Lastly, we demonstrate the dispensability of TRBV9 for antigen recognition. Collectively, our data suggest that, in HLA-B27-associated autoimmunity, early antigen exposure and differentiation of pathogenic CD8 T cells may occur in enteric organs.">

 Multiple therapies with immune mechanisms of action such as CAR T-cells and bispecific antibodies are now approved for relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (rrLBCL). The efficacy of these therapies is likely influenced by lymphoma microenvironment (LME) characteristics, but these have not been directly characterized in a comprehensive fashion. We therefore performed single-nucleus multiome (RNA + ATAC), bulk RNA, and WES of 119 biopsies from 114 patients to capture both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types. After stringent quality control, 970,239 cells remained. Non-B-cell lineages were classified into 76 transcriptionally-distinct cell types using unsupervised clustering. LME archetypes were defined by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) of non-B cell types. Associations with CAR T-cell outcomes were validated using published Nanostring data from the ZUMA7 clinical trial. NMF clustering identified 5 cellular modules: lymph-node 1 [LN1] and lymph-node 2 [LN2] that are characterized by lymph-node structural cell types, antigen presenting cells and naïve and memory T-cells; T-effector/exhausted [TEX] characterized by high frequencies of effector and exhausted CD8 T-cells; and fibroblast/macrophage 1 [FMAC1] and 2 [FMAC2] that were characterized by high frequencies of macrophage subsets and fibroblast subsets including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The pairs of LN1 and LN2 modules, and FMAC1 and FMAC2 modules, were correlated and therefore considered collectively in tumor archetype construction, resulting in three major archetypes: LN (33% of tumors), TEX (25% of tumors) and FMAC (42% of tumors). Among these biopsies, 17 were obtained immediately prior to, and 13 were subsequent to CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Although numbers were limited, these cases suggested that the LN archetype was associated with greater benefit from CAR T cell therapy. We therefore leveraged our bulk RNA-sequencing data plus published Nanostring data from the ZUMA7 study of axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) in second line rrLBCL to develop a Naïve Bayes classifier for these archetypes. Evaluation of response data from ZUMA7 showed that the greatest benefit for axi-cel compared to chemotherapy was observed within the LN subtype (HR=0.18; P<0.0001), compared to the FMAC (HR=0.4; P<0.0001) and TEX (HR=0.71; P=0.23), with median PFS in the axi-cel arm of 30.16, 4.94, and 4.53 months respectively. Furthermore, LN subtype patients had significantly better outcomes compared to FMAC and TEX subtype patients in the axi-cel arm (HR=0.5, P=0.006) but not in the chemotherapy arm (HR=1.3; P=0.23). Therefore, accurate construction of the rrLBCL LME using direct cell measurements of both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells with single-cell genomics permits the identification of cell types, cell modules, and LME archetypes with important implications for LBCL biology, and may present an opportunity for LME-guided selection of patients most likely to benefit from cellular therapy.

        <tr id="Cytokines are small proteins that modulate the activity of the immune system. Because of their potent immunomodulatory properties, some recombinant cytokines have undergone clinical development and have gained marketing authorization for the therapy of certain forms of cancer. Recombinant cytokines are typically administered at ultralow doses, as many of them can cause substantial toxicity even at submilligram quantities. In an attempt to increase the therapeutic index, fusion proteins based on tumor-homing antibodies (also called "immunocytokines") have been considered, and some products in this class have reached late-stage clinical trials. While antibody-cytokine fusions, which preferentially localize in the neoplastic mass, can activate tumor-resident leukocytes and may be more efficacious than their nontargeted counterparts, such products typically conserve an intact cytokine activity, which may prevent escalation to curative doses. To further improve tolerability, several strategies have been conceived for the development of antibody-cytokine fusions with "activity-on-demand", acting on tumors but helping spare normal tissues from undesired toxicity. In this article, we have reviewed some of the most promising strategies, outlining their potential as well as possible limitations.">

        <tr id="Introduction Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) overexpression on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is associated with poor prognosis and worse clinical outcomes. Selective ablation of pro-tumorgenic FAP+ stromal cells with CAR-T cells may be a new therapeutic strategy. However, the clinical use of FAP-CAR T cells is suggested to proceed with caution for occasional poor efficacy and induction of on-target off-tumor toxicity (OTOT), including lethal osteotoxicity and cachexia. Hence, more investigations and preclinical trials are required to optimize the FAP-CAR T cells and to approve their safety and efficacy. Methods In this study, we designed second-generation CAR T cells targeting FAP with 4-1BB as a co-stimulatory molecule, and tested their cytotoxicity against FAP-positive cells (hFAP-HT1080 cells and a variety of primary CAFs) in vitro and in Cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Results Results showed that our FAP-CAR T cells were powerfully potent in killing human and murine FAP-positive tumor cells and CAFs in multiple types of tumors in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice and in patient-derived xenografts (PDX) model. And they were proved to be biologically safe and exhibit low-level OTOT.

        <tr id="One of the major challenges in the choice of the best therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients affected by hemophilia A (HA) is the definition of criteria predicting the formation of factor VIII (FVIII) neutralizing antibodies, called inhibitors. Both genetic and environmental elements influencing the immune response toward FVIII have been identified but still not all the factors causing the pathological rejection of FVIII have been identified. Since there is a connection between coagulation and inflammation, here we assessed the role played by the FVIII deficiency in shaping the humoral and cellular response toward an antigen other than FVIII itself. To this aim, we challenged both HA and wild-type (WT) mice with either FVIII or ovalbumin (OVA) and followed antigen-specific antibody level, immune cell population frequency and phenotype up to 9 weeks after the last antigen booster. The activation threshold was evaluated in vitro by stimulating the murine T cells with a decreasing dose of α-CD3. The humoral response to FVIII was similar between the two groups while both the in vivo and in vitro experiments highlighted an antigen-independent sensitivity of HA compared with WT T cells causing an increase in memory T-cell conversion and proliferation capability.">

 Although CAR-T19 therapy is widely used for relapsed/refractory B cell lymphomas, approximately half of patients experience post CAR-T relapse. The mechanisms underlying this resistance remain largely unknown and efforts to overcome this limitation are hindered by the lack of suitable pre-clinical models for study. To address these unmet needs, we generated a novel genetically engineered mouse model with conditional expression of Ezh2Y641F and BCL2 in germinal center (GC) B cells. Ezh2/BCL2 mice developed follicular lymphoma (FL) which histologically and transcriptionally recapitulates human FL. Moreover, we established a cell line derived from an Ezh2/BCL2 mouse that developed transformed FL (tFL). Injection of the cell line named “tFL-P6” in immunocompetent C57BL6 recipients resulted in rapid disease progression that histologically and transcriptionally mimics human tFL. Treatment of tFL-P6 with EZH2 inhibitors (EZH2i) didn’t affect proliferation and viability, however, the number of pretreated cells was significantly reduced when co-cultured with T cells. EZH2i pretreated tFL-P6 displayed extended interaction with T cells, as measured by live imaging. EZH2i reprogrammed tFL-P6 to restore T cell engagement genes such as ICOSL, ICAM1, OX40L, and integrins, as well as cytokines and chemokines involved in T cell recruitment, therefore enhancing immunogenicity. Notably, pretreated tFL-P6 cells were rejected by C57BL6 whereas they developed lethal disease in immunodeficient recipients. Pre-treatment of tFL-P6 as well as human DLBCL and PDX-derived cell lines significantly enhanced CAR-T19 cell killing effects in vitro. Administering CAR-T cells in mice engrafted with EZH2i-pretreated tFL-P6 significantly reduced the tumor burden and prolonged their survival (100% vs 30%, p<0.01). To assess the direct interactions between lymphoma cells and CAR-T cells in vivo, we performed intravital 2-photon imaging of popliteal lymph nodes using dTomato labeled CAR-T cells and GFP+ tFL-P6 cells. Pretreatment of tFL-P6 cells with EZH2i doubled the recruitment of CAR-T cells in the microenvironment and enhanced the duration of contact and surface engagement with CAR-T cells. To explore the impact of EZH2 inhibition on CAR-T cells, we manufactured CAR-T cells from splenic T cells of mice treated with EZH2i or vehicle for 14 days. Prior exposure to EZH2i didn’t affect proliferation and transduction during CAR-T production. Ex vivo assays with those CAR-T cells and tFL-P6 cells showed a superior killing effect and expansion of EZH2i-exposed CAR-T (p<0.001). Mice bearing tFL-P6 lymphomas displayed a longer survival when infused with EZH2i-pretreated CAR-T cells (p=0.06). Pretreatment with EZH2i resulted in an increased memory/effector ratio (p<0.01) and reduction of PD1+CD38+ exhausted CD8CAR-T cells (p<0.001). Overall, EZH2i improved CAR-T therapy by enhancing lymphoma cell immunogenicity and CAR-T cell functions. These results prompted the initiation of a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination in R/R B cell lymphomas (NCT05934838).

        <tr id="Antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) by monocytes and macrophages contributes significantly to the efficacy of many therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including anti-CD20 rituximab (RTX) targeting CD20+ B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). However, ADP is constrained by various immune checkpoints, notably the anti-phagocytic CD47 molecule, necessitating strategies to overcome this resistance. The IgG2 isotype of RTX induces CD20-mediated apoptosis in B-cell lymphoma cells, and significantly enhances Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis when used in combination with RTX-IgG1 or RTX-IgG3 mAbs, as previously described. Here, we report that the apoptotic effect of RTX-IgG2 on lymphoma cells contributes to changes in the tumor cell’s CD47 profile by reducing its overall expression and altering its surface distribution. Furthermore, when RTX-IgG2 is combined with other lymphoma-targeting mAbs, such as anti-PD-L1 or anti-CD59, it significantly enhances the ADP of lymphoma cells compared to single mAb treatment. In summary, RTX-IgG2 acts as a potent phagocytic enhancer by promoting Fc-receptor mediated phagocytosis through apoptosis and reduction of CD47 in malignant CD20+ B-cells. RTX-IgG2 represents a valuable therapeutic component in enhancing the effectiveness of different mAbs targeting B-cell NHL.">

        <tr id="Venetoclax is the first example of personalized medicine for multiple myeloma (MM), with meaningful clinical activity as a monotherapy and in combination in myeloma patients harboring the t(11:14) translocation. However, despite the high response rates and prolonged PFS, a significant proportion of patients eventually relapse. Here, we aimed to study adaptive molecular responses after the acquisition of venetoclax resistance in sensitive t(11:14) MM cell models. We therefore generated single-cell venetoclax-resistant t(11:14) MM cell lines and investigated the mechanisms contributing to resistance as well as the cells' sensitivity to other treatments. Our data suggests that acquired resistance to venetoclax is characterized by reduced mitochondrial priming and changes in BCL-2 family proteins' expression in MM cells, conferring broad resistance to standard-of-care anti-myeloma drugs. However, our results show that the resistant cells are still sensitive to immunotherapeutic treatments, highlighting the need to consider appropriate sequencing of these treatments following venetoclax-based regimens.">

        <tr id="Introduction & Objective: The recent successful large-scale generation of human stem cell (hPSC)-derived β-like cells (sBC) provides an abundant cell source for replacement therapy efforts to treat patients suffering from autoimmune diabetes. However, even in the presence of systemic immune suppression, transplanted sBC, like primary human islets, are susceptible to allogeneic and recurrent autoimmune attack. Different strategies leveraging genome engineering technologies have been tested to achieve localized immune protection for β-cell grafts. Increased expression of the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1 at the graft site has shown promise in reducing either xenogeneic or allogeneic immune responses in preclinical animal models. However, whether PD-L1 expression can protect sBC grafts from recurring autoimmunity is poorly understood, largely due to the absence of appropriate model systems.
 Methods: Here we adoptively transferred diabetogenic mouse T cells from NOD mice expressing human HLA class I into immunodeficient NSG mice bearing HLA matched sBC grafts as a novel model of human autoimmunity in vivo.
 Results: Using this novel autoimmune in vivo model, sBC grafts that were genetically modified to express high levels of PD-L1 exhibit greater survival compared to unmodified control grafts but were also lost within 3 weeks due to robust T cell infiltration. Interestingly, we also observed destruction of HLA class 1 knockout sBC grafts, suggesting a potential and important role for autoreactive CD4+ T cells. We are currently expanding our findings using HLA matched in vitro co-culture assays and performing additional transplantation studies with purified diabetogenic CD8+ T cells.
 Conclusion: Collectively, our data suggest that PD-L1 expression on sBC alone might not provide sufficient protection from recurring autoimmunity, unlike allogenic responses, and highlights the need for better model systems to interrogate human autoimmunity in a matched manner.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Autologous BCMA-specific CAR T-cell therapies have substantial activity in multiple myeloma (MM). However, due to logistical limitations and BCMAlow relapses, there is a need for alternatives. UCARTCS1 cells are ‘off-the-shelf’ allogeneic CAR T-cells derived from healthy donors targeting SLAMF7 (CS1), which is highly expressed in MM cells. In this study, we evaluated the preclinical activity of UCARTCS1 in MM cell lines, in bone marrow (BM) samples obtained from MM patients and in an MM mouse model. Methods Luciferase-transduced MM cell lines were incubated with UCARTCS1 cells or control (non-transduced, SLAMF7/TCRαβ double knock-out) T-cells at different effector to target ratios for 24 hours. MM cell lysis was assessed by bioluminescence. Anti-MM activity of UCARTCS1 was also evaluated in 29 BM samples obtained from newly diagnosed patients (n=10), daratumumab-naïve relapsed/refractory patients (n=10) and daratumumab-refractory patients (n=9) in 24-hour flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity assays. Finally, UCARTCS1 activity was assessed in mouse xenograft models. Results UCARTCS1 cells induced potent CAR-mediated, and dose-dependent lysis of both MM cell lines and primary MM cells. There was no difference in ex vivo activity of UCARTCS1 between heavily pretreated and newly diagnosed patients. In addition, efficacy of UCARTCS1 was not affected by SLAMF7 expression level on MM cells, proportion of tumor cells, or frequency of regulatory T-cells in BM samples obtained from MM patients. UCARTCS1 treatment eliminated SLAMF7+ non-malignant immune cells in a dose-dependent manner, however lysis of normal cells was less pronounced compared to that of MM cells. Additionally, durable anti-MM responses were observed with UCARTCS1 in an MM xenograft model. Conclusions These results demonstrate that UCARTCS1 has potent anti-MM activity against MM cell lines and primary MM cells, as well as in an MM xenograft model and support the evaluation of UCARTCS1 in patients with advanced MM.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), consisting of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) covalently linked to cytotoxic drugs via chemical linkers, are a kind of promising tumor immunotherapy. ADCs also face a number of challenges, including unavoidable adverse effects, drug resistance, tumor targeting and payload release. To address these issues, in addition to optimizing the individual components of ADCs, such as new payloads, linkage sites and new targets, and using bispecific antibodies to increase precision, attention should be paid to optimizing the dosage of ADCs.


RECENT FINDINGS
There are currently 7 ADCs approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for hematological malignancies, and dozens of other ADCs are either in clinical trials or in the process of applying for marketing. In recent clinical studies targeting ADCs in hematologic malignancies, in addition to validating effectiveness in different indications, researchers have attempted to combine ADCs with other chemotherapeutic agents in anticipation of increased therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the availability of bispecific antibodies may increase the safety and efficacy of ADCs.


SUMMARY
This review summarized the progress of research on ADCs in hematological malignancies, the challenges being faced, and possible future directions to improve the efficacy of ADCs, which can provide novel insight into the future exploration of ADCs in the treatment of hematological malignancies.">

 Approximatively 40% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients exhibit primary resistance to standard therapy. Moreover, relapse is a common event in first-line responders. Overexpression of BCL-2 is a major determinant of resistance to chemotherapy in several B-cell neoplasms, including DLBCL. While venetoclax, a specific BCL-2 inhibitor, has dramatically changed the therapeutic landscape of other B-cell malignancies, only 12% of DLBCL patients exhibit a complete response to venetoclax, with a mean progression-free survival of 1 month. In this scenario, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. We tested the possibility to overcome the resistance of DLBCL cells to venetoclax by rewiring their reactive oxygen species (ROS) set point, which is higher in cancer cells compared to their healthy counterparts. We employed a panel of 14 DLBCL cell lines of both germinal center B-cell (GCB) and activated B-cell (ABC) derivation. Cell death, ROS accumulation, and NADPH levels were evaluated upon treatment of DLBCL cells with three inhibitors of NADPH production, the central electron donor required to maintain ROS scavengers in their reduced form. The synergism between venetoclax and inhibitors of NADPH production was assessed through isobologram analysis. RNA-Seq, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blot techniques were used to dissect the mechanism of cooperation between venetoclax and inhibition of NADPH production. The Zebrafish model was used for in vivo validation of the therapeutic approach. We observed that inhibiting NADPH production dramatically improves the response to venetoclax by more than 500-fold, while no toxic effects were observed in normal B-cells. By generating isogenic cell lines with differing sensitivity to venetoclax, we demonstrated that the resistance to this drug positively correlates with the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL. Moreover, RNA-seq and protein analyses indicated that the increase of ROS levels engages the integrated stress response (ISR). Pharmacological inhibition and gene silencing of key effectors of the ISR rescued DLBCL cells from cell death induced by our therapeutic strategy. We also confirmed the ROS-dependency of BCL-xL downregulation using both ROS scavengers and by pulsing cells with exogenous hydrogen peroxide. Finally, in vivo studies confirmed the sensitization of DLBCL cells to venetoclax upon the inhibition of NADPH production. Taken together, these results provide the first proof-of-principle evidence for a ROS-based strategy to increase the therapeutic window of venetoclax in DLBCL, suggesting a viable therapeutic avenue to treat refractory patients.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancers. However, their effectiveness meets challenges in solid tumors. Modifications to CAR-T cells altered stimulatory domains or added further functions with transgenic proteins (e.g., cytokines, chemokine receptors, degrading enzymes) to match specific barriers of the tumor microenvironment. But despite these enhancements, the inherent limitations of CAR-T cells such as dependency on human leukocyte antigen (HLA), toxicities and high costs for preparing autologous cell products remain. In response, alternative types of immune cells with different effects and advantages have become the focus of adoptive cell therapy research. For instance, natural killer cells have the benefit of HLA-independent killing and macrophages possess additional functions such as phagocytosis and antigen presentation. As these cells come with distinct properties, clinicians and researchers need a thorough understanding of their effects and peculiarities. This review summarizes the different modes of action of these CAR-immune cells. Abstract Chimeric antigen receptor-T cells have spearheaded the field of adoptive cell therapy and have shown remarkable results in treating hematological neoplasia. Because of the different biology of solid tumors compared to hematological tumors, response rates of CAR-T cells could not be transferred to solid entities yet. CAR engineering has added co-stimulatory domains, transgenic cytokines and switch receptors to improve performance and persistence in a hostile tumor microenvironment, but because of the inherent cell type limitations of CAR-T cells, including HLA incompatibility, toxicities (cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity) and high costs due to the logistically challenging preparation process for autologous cells, the use of alternative immune cells is gaining traction. NK cells and γδ T cells that do not need HLA compatibility or macrophages and dendritic cells with additional properties such as phagocytosis or antigen presentation are increasingly seen as cellular vehicles with potential for application. As these cells possess distinct properties, clinicians and researchers need a thorough understanding of their peculiarities and commonalities. This review will compare these different cell types and their specific modes of action seen upon CAR activation.">

        <tr id="Achieving long-term disease control using therapeutic immunomodulation is a long-standing concept with a strong tradition in blood malignancies. Besides allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation that continues to provide potentially curative treatment for otherwise challenging diagnoses, recent years have seen impressive progress in immunotherapies for leukemias and lymphomas with immune checkpoint blockade, bispecific monoclonal antibodies, and CAR T cell therapies. Despite their success, non-response, relapse, and immune toxicities remain frequent, thus prioritizing the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms and identifying predictive biomarkers. The increasing availability of single-cell genomic tools now provides a system’s immunology view to resolve the molecular and cellular mechanisms of immunotherapies at unprecedented resolution. Here, we review recent studies that leverage these technological advancements for tracking immune responses, the emergence of immune resistance, and toxicities. As single-cell immune monitoring tools evolve and become more accessible, we expect their wide adoption for routine clinical applications to catalyze more precise therapeutic steering of personal immune responses.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary For metastatic urothelial cancer (UC), platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy are used, with newer treatments like monoclonal antibodies (e.g., pembrolizumab) showing varied success. Traditional treatments often fail to provide long-term responses. Advances in molecular understanding of UC have led to targeted therapies, identifying six UC subclasses influencing treatment responses. Promising drugs include the fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor erdafitinib and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). ADCs represent a significant advancement in UC treatment, using monoclonal antibodies linked to cytotoxic agents to target cancer cells. UC is suitable for ADC therapy due to high antigen expression, enhancing efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity. Despite immune checkpoint inhibitors, advanced UC progresses rapidly with poor survival rates. Notable ADCs include enfortumab vedotin, effective alone and with pembrolizumab, and sacituzumab govitecan, showing effectiveness in studies. This review covers ADC mechanisms, mono- and combination therapies, resistance, and future perspectives, highlighting ADCs’ vital role in treating UC. Abstract Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have been a significant advancement in cancer therapy, particularly for urothelial cancer (UC). These innovative treatments, originally developed for hematological malignancies, use target-specific monoclonal antibodies linked to potent cytotoxic agents. This rational drug design efficiently delivers cancer cell-killing agents to cells expressing specific surface proteins, which are abundant in UC owing to their high antigen expression. UC is an ideal candidate for ADC therapy, as it enhances on-target efficacy while mitigating systemic toxicity. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the biology and mechanisms of tumor progression in UC. However, despite the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors, advanced UC is characterized by rapid progression and poor survival rates. Targeted therapies that have been developed include the anti-nectin 4 ADC enfortumab vedotin and the fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor erdafitinib. Enfortumab vedotin has shown efficacy in prospective studies in patients with advanced UC, alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. The anti-Trop-2 ADC sacituzumab govitecan has also demonstrated effectiveness in single-armed studies. This review highlights the mechanism of action of ADCs, their application in mono- and combination therapies, primary mechanisms of resistance, and future perspectives for their clinical use in UC treatment. ADCs have proven to be an increasingly vital component of the therapeutic landscape for urothelial carcinoma, filling a gap in the treatment of this progressive disease.">

        <tr id="Introduction: The development of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (sHGG) because of tumor treatment and/or the primary underlying hematologic disorder holds substantial clinical significance. B-cell-derived malignancies and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) represent important risk factors for the development of sHGG. In addition, the occurrence of acute thrombocytopenia (AT) induced by anti-CD20 therapy is a known, albeit rare, phenomenon. Case Presentation: A 54-year-old patient experiencing the first relapse of classical follicular lymphoma has commenced salvage therapy following the R-DHAP protocol. After rituximab infusion, platelet count dropped from 116x10^9/L to 13x10^9/L within 24 hours. Reduced IgG levels indicated moderate HGG, thus we immediately administered intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). Within five days after initiation of IVIg, platelet count increased and stabilized at >50x10^9/L. Conclusions: It seems possible that anti-CD20 mAb act like or activate similar mechanisms as autoantibodies in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Assuming that anti-CD20 therapy-induced AT is an ITP-like condition, HGG could be considered a potential risk factor. Thus, appropriate treatment of HGG with IVIg prior to anti-CD20 mAb therapy could potentially alleviate anti-CD20 therapy-induced AT. .">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Myelofibrosis (MF) is a BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, cytopenias, a potential for leukemic transformation, and increased mortality. Patients who are ineligible for stem cell transplant rely on pharmacologic therapies of noncurative intent, whose cornerstone consists of JAK inhibitors (JAKi). While current JAKi are efficacious in controlling symptoms and splenic volume, none meaningfully reduce clonal burden nor halt disease progression, and patients oftentimes develop JAKi intolerant, relapsed, or refractory MF. As such, there remains an urgent necessity for second-line options and novel therapies with disease-modifying properties.


AREAS COVERED
In this review, we delineate the mechanistic rationale, along with the latest safety and efficacy data, of investigational JAKi-based MF treatment strategies, with a focus on JAKi monotherapies and combinations of novel agents with approved JAKi. Our literature search consisted of extensive review of PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov.


EXPERT OPINION
A myriad of promising MF-directed therapies are in late-phase studies. Following their approval, treatment selection should be tailored to patient-specific treatment goals and disease characteristics, with an emphasis on combination therapies of JAKi with novel agents of differing mechanistic targets that possess anti-clonal properties, in attempt to alter disease course and concurrently limit dose-dependent JAKi toxicities.">

        <tr id="CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapies, including axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel), tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel), and lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel), have transformed the treatment landscape for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), showcasing significant efficacy but also highlighting toxicity risks such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). The FDA has mandated patients remain close to the treatment center for four weeks as part of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to monitor and manage these toxicities, which, while cautious, may add to cost of care, be burdensome for patients and their families, and present challenges related to patient access and socioeconomic disparities. This retrospective study across 9 centers involving 475 patients infused with axi-cel, tisa-cel, and liso-cel from 2018 to 2023, aims to assess CRS and ICANS onset and duration, as well as causes of non-relapse mortality (NRM) in real-world CAR T recipients. While differences were noted in the incidence and duration of CRS and ICANS between CAR T products, new-onset CRS and ICANS are exceedingly rare after two weeks following infusion (0% and 0.7% of patients, respectively). No new cases of CRS occurred after two weeks and a single case of new-onset ICANS occurred in the third week following infusion. NRM is driven by ICANS in the early follow-up period (1.1% until day 28), then by infection through three months post-infusion (1.2%). This study provides valuable insights into optimizing CAR T therapy monitoring and our findings may provide a framework to reduce physical and financial constraints for patients.">

        <tr id="To interrogate the role of specific immune cells in infection, cancer and autoimmunity, immunologists commonly use monoclonal depletion antibodies (depletion-mAbs) or genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). To generate a tool that combines specific advantages and avoids select drawbacks of the two methods we engineer adeno-associated viral vectors expressing depletion-mAbs (depletion-AAVs). Single-dose depletion-AAV administration permanently eliminates lymphocyte subsets in mice while avoiding accessory deficiencies of GEMMs such as marginal zone defects in B cell-deficient animals. Depletion-AAVs can be used irrespective of the animals’ genetic background, and multiple depletion-AAVs can readily be combined. Exploiting depletion-AAV technology, we show that B cells are required for unimpaired CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to chronic viral infection. Importantly, CD8 T cells fail to suppress viremia when B cells are depleted, and they only help resolving chronic infection if antibodies suppress viral loads. Our study positions depletion-AAVs as a versatile tool for immunological research.">

        <tr id="Myelofibrosis (MF) is a rare BCR-ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of stem cells, with mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL genes. MF presents in primary and secondary forms, with common symptoms including splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Diagnostic criteria involve bone marrow examination and mutation studies. Current treatments are limited, with allogeneic stem cell transplant as the only curative option. Recent FDA approval of Momelotinib (MMB) offers new promise for MF patients with anemia. MMB, a JAK1/2 and ACVR1 inhibitor, effectively reduces spleen size, improves hemoglobin levels, and decreases transfusion dependency. The MOMENTUM trial compared MMB to danazol in JAK inhibitor-treated MF patients with anemia, showing MMB’s superior symptom relief and transfusion independence rates. Additionally, the SIMPLIFY-1 and SIMPLIFY-2 trials evaluated MMB in JAK inhibitor-naïve and experienced patients, respectively, confirming MMB’s non-inferiority to ruxolitinib in spleen volume reduction and highlighting its benefits in transfusion requirements. MMB’s unique dual inhibition mechanism addresses anemia by suppressing hepcidin production, thus enhancing erythropoiesis. These trials collectively suggest MMB as an effective treatment for MF, improving quality of life and offering a survival advantage for patients with anemia. Despite challenges, such as trial design limitations and adverse events, MMB represents a significant advancement in MF management, providing a new therapeutic option for a previously underserved patient population.">

        <tr id="The study aimed to investigate the expression profiles of transcription factors, cytokines, and co-stimulatory molecules in helper T (Th)-cell subsets within bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples of patients with interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Twenty ILDs patients were included in the study, comprising those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (n:8), autoimmune-related ILDs (auto-ILD) (n:4), and orphan diseases (O-ILD) (n:8), alongside five control subjects. Flow cytometry was employed to evaluate the Th to cytotoxic T cell (CTL) ratio in BAL fluid, while cytopathological examination assessed macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was utilized to investigate the expressions in Th1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T (Treg) cells. Results revealed elevated Th cell to CTL ratios across all patient groups compared to controls. Furthermore, upregulation of Th1, Th2, Th17, and T-cell factors was observed in all patient groups compared to controls. Interestingly, upregulation of CD28 and downregulation of CTLA-4 and PD-1 gene expression were consistent across all ILDs groups, highlighting potential immune dysregulation. This study provides a comprehensive exploration of molecular immunological mechanisms in ILDs patients, underscoring the dominance of Th2 and Th17 responses and revealing novel findings regarding the dysregulation of CD28, CTLA-4, and PD-1 expressions in ILDs for the first time.">

 Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, renowned for its successes in cancer treatment, is now entering the field of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) therapy, presenting both opportunities and challenges. With the emergence of broadly neutralizing antibodies, multi-target CARs, and T cell receptor–like antibodies aimed at increasing specificity in targeting HIV reservoirs, CAR-T therapy is synergizing with other cutting-edge treatments, including gene-editing technologies, therapeutic vaccines, and latency-reversing agents, in pursuit of a potential functional cure. In this review, we delve into the role of CAR-T therapy in HIV treatment, highlighting its potential to overcome clinical obstacles. We discuss advancements in targeting strategies within CAR constructs and the intricate regulation of T cell proliferation and chemotaxis. Moreover, we explore the use of diverse immune cells, such as gamma-delta T cells and natural killer cells. We review advanced biotechnologies, manufacturing innovations, viral mechanisms, and immune microenvironments. We also discuss the current research landscape and potential future applications of CAR-T therapy against HIV, which remains a critical global health challenge.

        <tr id="Immune-mediated diseases are characterized by aberrant immune responses, posing significant challenges to global health. In both inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, dysregulated immune reactions mediated by tissue-residing immune and non-immune cells precipitate chronic inflammation and tissue damage that is amplified by peripheral immune cell extravasation into the tissue. Chemokine receptors are pivotal in orchestrating immune cell migration, yet deciphering the signaling code across cell types, diseases and tissues remains an open challenge. To delineate disease-specific cell-cell communications involved in immune cell migration, we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across diverse immune diseases and tissues. Our comprehensive analysis spanned multiple immune disorders affecting major organs: atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (skin), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (lung), ulcerative colitis (colon), IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis (kidney). By interrogating ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, alterations in cell proportions, and differential gene expression, we unveiled intricate disease- specific and common immune cell chemoattraction and extravasation patterns. Our findings delineate disease-specific L-R networks and shed light on shared immune responses across tissues and diseases. Insights gleaned from this analysis hold promise for the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at modulating immune cell migration to mitigate inflammation and tissue damage. This nuanced understanding of immune cell dynamics at the single-cell resolution opens avenues for precision medicine in immune disease management.">

This study explores the impact of NOTCH1 signalling on venetoclax sensitivity in vitro. Although NOTCH1 activation minimally impaired the susceptibility of CLL cells to venetoclax, ex vivo cell competition studies reveal that cells with constitutive NOTCH1 activation outgrew their wild-type counterparts in the presence of ongoing venetoclax exposure. Our findings suggest that while NOTCH1 activation is insufficient to confer venetoclax refractoriness, there is enhanced potential for cells with NOTCH1 activation to escape and thus become fully resistant to venetoclax.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has achieved remarkable remission in patients with B-cell malignancies. However, its efficacy in treating solid tumors remains limited. Here, we investigated a combination therapy approach using an engineered long-acting interleukin (IL)-7 (rhIL-7-hyFc or NT-I7) and CAR-T cells targeting three antigens, glypican-2 (GPC2), glypican-3 (GPC3), and mesothelin (MSLN), against multiple solid tumor types including liver cancer, neuroblastoma, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer in mice. Methods CAR-T cells targeting GPC2, GPC3, and MSLN were used in combination with NT-I7 to assess the anticancer activity. Xenograft tumor models, including the liver cancer orthotopic model, were established using NOD scid gamma mice engrafted with cell lines derived from hepatocellular carcinoma, neuroblastoma, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer. The mice were monitored by bioluminescence in vivo tumor imaging and tumor volume measurement using a caliper. Immunophenotyping of CAR-T cells on NT-I7 stimulation was evaluated for memory markers, exhaust markers, and T-cell signaling molecules by flow cytometry and western blotting. Results Compared with the IL-2 combination, preclinical evaluation of NT-I7 exhibited regression of solid tumors via enhanced occupancy of CD4+ CAR-T, improved T-cell expansion, reduced exhaustion markers (programmed cell death protein 1 or PD-1 and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 or LAG-3) expression, and increased generation of stem cell-like memory CAR-T cells. The STAT5 pathway was demonstrated to be downstream of NT-I7 signaling, mediated by increased expression of the IL-7 receptor expression in CAR-T cells. Furthermore, CAR-T cells improved efficacy against tumors with low antigen density when combined with NT-I7 in mice, presenting an avenue for patients with heterogeneous antigenic profiles. Conclusion This study provides a rationale for NT-I7 plus CAR-T cell combination therapy for solid tumors in humans.">

Due to its chronic nature, it has been increasingly hard to identify and treat effectively. The study establishes an SMZL mouse model and explores the potential of enhancing Rituximab treatment using Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs). Designed experiment includes how to establish the NFS.N mice model, characterization of the disease on mice and recovery standard of mice. First, SMZL mice model is establish followed by histology and immunocytochemistry investigation which looks directly at the mices lesion. Then flow cytology is carried out which looks at the expression level of IgM, IgK, CD23, CD45 etc., before bone marrow infiltration is carried out. A controlled experiment of three groups of mice is designed, including mice treated with conventional Rituximab, delivery with LNPs and delivering empty LNPs, respectively. The effect of LNPs on treating mice SMZL is investigated. And some expected results and analysis methods were also discussed alongside with recovery standard. This experiment aims to provide theoretical support to the development of more effective and targeted therapies for this specific type of lymphoma. However, this is only an design rigorous experimentation strengthens the scientific validity of these findings.">

        <tr id="The tuberculin skin test (TST) is a cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity reaction to antigen from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We provide the first single cell sequencing characterisation of the human TST reaction, based on skin suction blisters induced at the site of the TST on day 2 in 31 individuals. Integrated single cell RNA and TCR sequencing showed the immune response to be dominated by T cells, with smaller populations of NK cells and myeloid cells. T cells comprised CD4, CD8, gamma/delta and NK T cells, with 50% of all T cells identified as cytotoxic and 14% as regulatory. Interferon gamma gene expression was strongest in CD8 T cells, and distinct CD4 T helper lineages could not unambiguously be identified at this time point. Amongst myeloid cells, 63% displayed antimicrobial gene expression and 28% were functionally polarised towards antigen presentation with higher levels of HLA class 2 expression. We derived and validated transcriptional signatures for cell types and cellular functions relevant to the immune landscape of the TST. These data help to improve our understanding of the immune response to Mtb and enable further exploration of bulk transcriptomic data through context-specific cellular deconvolution.">

        <tr id="Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy for β-thalassemia major in children. However, it often induces graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), which is associated with complications. In the present study, we used cyclophosphamide (Cy) to treat a thalassemia patient post-HSCT to reduce the adverse effects of GVHD. We monitored the numbers and phenotype of granulocytes. In this case study, an 11-year-old female patient, diagnosed with β-thalassemia major (Pesaro class II), was treated with Cy before and after HSCT with mobilized CD34+ cells. Both the relative and absolute granulocyte counts, as well as CD33+CD11b+ cell counts, increased significantly after HSCT until day 56. However, they suddenly began to decrease after day 56, accompanied by severe diarrhea, skin rash, and a decrease in bilirubin levels compared to day -12. Furthermore, compared to day -12, IL-22 levels increased until day 56, and then decreased, while IDO levels continued to rise after day 56. Our data suggest the potential use of IL-22 and IDO as biomarkers for GVHD assessment. It also indicates that Cy promotes HSCT reconstitution by increasing CD33+CD11b+ cells, which may play a crucial role in reducing GVHD risks. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism behind GVHD recurrence.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The need for reliable biomarkers to predict clinical benefit from anti-PD1 treatment in metastatic melanoma (MM) patients remains unmet. Several parameters have been considered in the tumor environment or the blood, but none has yet achieved sufficient accuracy for routine clinical practice. Whole blood samples from MM patients receiving second-line anti-PD1 treatment (NCT02626065), collected longitudinally, were analyzed by flow cytometry to assess the immune cell subsets absolute numbers, the expression of immune checkpoints or ligands on T cells and the functionality of innate immune cells and T cells. Clinical response was assessed according to Progression-Free Survival (PFS) status at one-year following initiation of anti-PD1 (responders: PFS > 1 year; non-responders: PFS ≤ 1 year). At baseline, several phenotypic and functional alterations in blood immune cells were observed in MM patients compared to healthy donors, but only the proportion of polyfunctional memory CD4+ T cells was associated with response to anti-PD1. Under treatment, a decreased frequency of HVEM on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after 3 months of treatment identified responding patients, whereas its receptor BTLA was not modulated. Both reduced proportion of CD69-expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and increased number of polyfunctional blood memory T cells after 3 months of treatment were associated with response to anti-PD1. Of upmost importance, the combination of changes of all these markers accurately discriminated between responding and non-responding patients. These results suggest that drugs targeting HVEM/BTLA pathway may be of interest to improve anti-PD1 efficacy.">

        <tr id="Introduction Venetoclax is a BCL-2 inhibitor with proven efficacy in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and translocation t(11;14). However, its role in plasma cell leukemia (PCL) remains unclear. Herein, we aimed to report a case of relapsed MM with secondary PCL and t(11;14) achieving complete (CR) and durable remission with venetoclax therapy. Case presentation A 52-year-old gentleman was diagnosed with MM-free light chain lambda (ISS III) in December 2016. He received induction therapy, followed by autologous stem cell transplant. (ASCT) in May 2017 and maintenance. A year later, the patient relapsed with secondary PCL. His cytogenetics analysis revealed t(11; 14). The patient failed salvage chemotherapy and was shifted to venetoclax with dexamethasone treatment. The patient attained complete remission (CR), which was maintained for two years and a half before he developed fatal COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusion In comparison with the reported literature, this case report offers the latest compilation of the available evidence on the use of venetoclax in patients with PCL. Furthermore, our patient achieved CR for the longest reported durable response in literature thus far. Prospective clinical trials are needed to elucidate the optimal dosage, combination, and duration of treatment, ensuring better representation and generalizability of the findings. Meanwhile, venetoclax may be considered as a therapeutic option in patients with PCL t(11;14).">

        <tr id="T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells can counteract the B cell helper activity of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and hinder the production of antibodies against self-antigens or allergens. A mechanistic understanding of the cytokines initiating the differentiation of human regulatory T (Treg) cells into Tfr cells is still missing. Herein, we report that low doses of the pro-Tfh cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) drive the induction of a Tfr cell program on activated human Treg cells while also preserving their regulatory function. Mechanistically, we found that IL-12 led to STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 4) phosphorylation and binding to IL-12–driven follicular signature genes. Patients with inborn errors of immunity in the IL12RB1 gene presented with a strong decrease in circulating Tfr cells and produced higher levels of anti-actin autoantibodies in vivo. Overall, this study unveils IL-12 as an inducer of Tfr cell differentiation in vivo and provides an approach for the in vitro generation of human Tfr-like cells. IL-12 promotes the acquisition of a follicular program in human regulatory T cells. Editor’s summary T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells balance the activity of T follicular helper cells and suppress B cell responses to self-antigens and allergens. However, the key signals involved in Tfr cell differentiation, particularly in humans, remain incompletely understood. By screening the effects of multiple cytokines on human regulatory T cells, Castaño et al. identified interleukin-12 (IL-12) as the most potent inducer of Tfr cell differentiation in vitro. IL-12 promoted the acquisition of a follicular gene expression program and STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 4) binding at signature follicular loci. In addition, patients bearing mutations in the IL12RB1 gene displayed a strong decrease in circulating Tfr cells. Together, these findings identify IL-12 as a driver of human Tfr cell differentiation, thus enabling their in vitro generation. —Claire Olingy">

 Background: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that exhibits clinical, pathological, and genetic heterogeneity. While generally thought to be incurable, recently demonstrated clinical activity of both chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells and bispecific antibodies suggest that immune-mediated therapies offer substantial benefit in this disease and underscores the value of understanding mechanisms of immune evasion in this disease.
 Aim: The aim of this project is to uncover distinct cellular networks driving immune evasion in MCL across disease sites.
 Methods: We analyzed 10 archival samples collected from 8 clinically annotated patients with untreated MCL, including mononuclear cells from peripheral blood (PB), lymph nodes (LN) and bone marrow (BM). After generating single-cell suspensions from tumors, we performed Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes sequencing (CITE-seq) and identified malignant B cells based on the co-expression of cyclin D1 (CCND1) and B cell markers (MS4A1, CD79A, CD79B). B and T cells were then subclustered using a reference mapping geneset. Molecular signatures database was utilized to perform geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA).
 Results: Our study first confirms the heterogeneity of mantle cell lymphoma across compartments (i.e PB, LN, BM), showing 5 different clusters of malignant cells, with different abundance in cell proportion among patients. We found that malignant B cells expressed different levels of CCND1 expression across tissue compartments. Furthermore, we identified a specific cluster of malignant cells, enriched in the PB, marked by decreased expression of the costimulatory receptor CD40 and higher levels of B-cell receptor signaling. This may explain the rapid response of circulating MCL cells to Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibition. Interestingly, the higher expression of CD40 on LN-resident MCL cells suggests that MCL cells may co-opt LN-resident T-cells to support their growth, as has been previously described. Consistent with this, T-cells from LN were phenotypically exhausted, suggesting that MCL cells within the LN leverage local interactions with T-cells to promote survival while avoiding T-cell-driven cytotoxicity. Finally, we also found that high level of Ki67 correlates with myeloid-cell abundance in the TME suggesting that monocytes may support tumor cell proliferation.
 Conclusion: These results provide a deeper understanding of tissue-specific heterogeneity in MCL, including distinct tumor-immune interactions at different tissue sites. In ongoing analyses, we will correlate these findings with patient outcomes and response to BTK inhibition and are currently analyzing samples from patients with relapsed disease to identify microenvironmental features associated with disease progression.

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease characterized by self-destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β cells by cytotoxic T cell activity. However, the pathogenic mechanism of T cell infiltration remains obscure. Recently, tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells have been shown to contribute to cytotoxic T cell recruitment. TRM cells are found present in human pancreas and are suggested to modulate immune homeostasis. Here, the role of TRM cells in the development of T1D is investigated. The presence of TRM cells in pancreatic islets is observed in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice before T1D onset. Mechanistically, elevated fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) potentiates the survival and alarming function of TRM cells by promoting fatty acid utilization and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) secretion, respectively. In NOD mice, genetic deletion of FABP4 or depletion of TRM cells using CD69 neutralizing antibodies resulted in a similar reduction of pancreatic cytotoxic T cell recruitment, a delay in diabetic incidence, and a suppression of CXCL10 production. Thus, targeting FABP4 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for T1D.">

        <tr id="Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare lymphoproliferative neoplasm considered incurable, with a median survival of 3-5 years. In recent years, Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) have been introduced, demonstrating high therapeutic activity. However, the prognosis for MCL patients failing ibrutinib therapy is particularly poor, with a survival expectation of a few months. In this phase II trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of the carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (KRD) combination in MCL patients who were relapsed/refractory (R/R) or intolerant to BTKi and in need of treatment. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of the KRD combination in terms of 12-month overall survival (12-month OS). From September 2019 to December 2020, 16 patients were enrolled from 11 Italian centers. After a median follow-up of 2.37 months (95% CI 0.92-6.47), the 12-month OS was 13%. The rate of grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) was 35%, and the overall response rate (ORR) was 19%. These results led to the premature termination of enrollment, as defined in the protocol stopping rules. The efficacy of the KRD combination in advanced-stage MCL patients who are R/R to BTKi is unsatisfactory and too toxic.">

        <tr id="Poor response to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy remains a major barrier in the management of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Multiple factors are associated with poor outcomes, including biological aging and female sex. More recently, it has emerged that a B-cell infiltrated pre-treatment immune microenvironment of NMIBC tumors can influence the response to intra-vesically administered BCG. The mechanisms underlying the roles of B cells in NMIBC are poorly understood. Here, we show that B-cell dominant tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), a hallmark feature of the chronic mucosal immune response, are abundant and located close to the epithelial compartment in pre-treatment tumors from BCG non-responders. Digital spatial proteomic profiling of whole tumor sections from male and female patients with NMIBC who underwent treatment with intravesical BCG, revealed higher expression of immune exhaustion-associated proteins within the tumor-adjacent TLSs in both responders and non-responders. Chronic local inflammation, induced by the N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) carcinogen, led to TLS formation with recruitment and differentiation of the immunosuppressive atypical B-cell (ABC) subset within the bladder microenvironment, predominantly in aging female mice compared to their male counterparts. Depletion of ABCs simultaneous to BCG treatment delayed cancer progression in female mice. Our findings provide evidence indicating a role for ABCs in BCG response and will inform future development of therapies targeting the B cell-exhaustion axis.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy considered incurable despite the recent therapeutic advances. Effective targeted therapies are therefore needed. Our previous studies proved that inhibiting CDK7 impairs the cell cycle and metabolic programs by disrupting E2F1 and MYC transcriptional activities, making it an appealing therapeutic target for MM. Given that CDK7 and BRD4 operate in two distinct regulatory axes in MM, we hypothesized that targeting these two complementary pathways simultaneously would lead to a deeper and more durable response. Indeed, combination therapy had superior activity against MM cell growth and viability, and induced apoptosis to a greater extent than single-agent therapy in both cell lines and patient cells. This synergistic activity was also observed in Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM) cells and with other inhibitors of E2F1 activity. Dual inhibition effectively impaired the MYC and E2F transcriptional programs and MM tumor growth and progression in xenograft animal models, providing evidence for combination therapy's potential as a therapeutic strategy in MM and WM.">

In non-responders, tumors show evidence of increased tumor proliferation, neuronal stem cell markers, and IL-1. Responders have increased type I/II interferons and pre-existing tissue resident (Trm) CD8 or Vd1 gd T cells that functionally converge with overlapping antigen-specific transcriptional programs and clonal expansion of public TCRs. Spatial transcriptomics demonstrated co-localization of T cells with B and dendritic cells, which supply chemokines and co-stimulation.

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. Immunotherapies are a promising approach in cancer treatment, particularly for aggressive forms of BC with high mortality rates. However, the current eligibility for immunotherapy remains limited to a limited fraction of patients with BC. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), originating from myeloid cells, are known for their dual role in immunosuppression and tumor promotion, significantly affecting patient outcomes by fostering the formation of premetastatic niches. Consequently, targeting MDSCs has emerged as a promising avenue for further exploration in therapeutic interventions. Leveraging nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems, which excel in accumulating drugs within tumors via passive or active targeting mechanisms, are a promising strategy for the use of MDSCs in the treatment of BC. The present review discusses the immunosuppressive functions of MDSCs, their role in BC, and the diverse strategies for targeting them in cancer therapy. Additionally, the present review discusses future advancements in BC treatments focusing on MDSCs. Furthermore, it elucidates the mechanisms underlying MDSC activation, recruitment and differentiation in BC progression, highlighting the clinical characteristics that render MDSCs suitable candidates for the therapy and targeted nanotherapy of BC.">

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint blockade targeting the adaptive immune system has revolutionized the treatment of cancer. Despite impressive clinical benefits observed, patient subgroups remain non-responsive underscoring the necessity for combinational therapies harnessing additional immune cells. Natural killer (NK) cells are emerging tools for cancer therapy. However, only subpopulations of NK cells that are differentially controlled by inhibitory receptors exert reactivity against particular cancer types. How to leverage the complete anti-tumor potential of all NK cell subsets without favoring the emergence of NK cell-resistant tumor cells remains unresolved. Methods We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout resistance screen in melanoma cells in co-cultures with human primary NK cells. We comprehensively evaluated factors regulating tumor resistance and susceptibility by focusing on NK cell subsets in an allogenic setting. Moreover, we tested therapeutic blocking antibodies currently used in clinical trials. Results Melanoma cells deficient in antigen-presenting or the IFNγ-signaling pathways were depleted in remaining NK cell-co-cultured melanoma cells and displayed enhanced sensitivity to NK cells. Treatment with IFNγ induced potent resistance of melanoma cells to resting, IL-2-cultured and ADCC-activated NK cells that depended on B2M required for the expression of both classical and non-classical MHC-I. IFNγ-induced expression of HLA-E mediated the resistance of melanoma cells to the NKG2A+ KIR− and partially to the NKG2A+ KIR+ NK cell subset. The expression of classical MHC-I by itself was sufficient for the inhibition of the NKG2A− KIR+, but not the NKG2A+ KIR+ NK cell subset. Treatment of NK cells with monalizumab, an NKG2A blocking mAb, enhanced the reactivity of a corresponding subset of NK cells. The combination of monalizumab with lirilumab, blocking KIR2 receptors, together with DX9, blocking KIR3DL1, was required to restore cytotoxicity of all NK cell subsets against IFNγ-induced resistant tumor cells in melanoma and tumors of different origins. Conclusion Our data reveal that in the context of NK cells, IFNγ induces the resistance of tumor cells by the upregulation of classical and non-classical MHC-I. Moreover, we reveal insights into NK cell subset reactivity and propose a therapeutic strategy involving combinational monalizumab/lirilumab/DX9 treatment to fully restore the antitumor response across NK cell subsets.">

        <tr id="STAT3 is required for Th17-cell differentiation, and dominant-negative STAT3 mutations cause Autosomal Dominant-Hyper-IgE Syndrome (AD-HIES), which is characterized by a lack of Th17-cells and recurrent infections with opportunistic extracellular pathogens. T-cell responses to opportunistic pathogens in AD-HIES patients have however not been characterized. We previously identified an enigmatic population of IL-10 producing CCR6+Th-cells that were largely non-polarised and lacked other subset-defining differentiation markers (“CCR6single-positive(SP)”). Here we report that CCR6SPT-cells are central memory T-cells (TCM) that expressed the stemness-associated transcription factors LEF1 and TCF7, but also RORγt, the lineage-defining transcription factor of Th17-cells. Non-polarized CCR6SPT-cells differentiated spontaneously to Th17-cells upon TCR stimulation, indicating that they were pre-committed to a Th17 fate. Spontaneous Th17 differentiation was promoted by an autocrine loop of STAT3-activating cytokines and inhibited by IL-4. IL-12 induced in addition IFN-γ, and consequently differentiation to Th1/17-cells. CCR6+T-cells were strongly reduced in AD-HIES and Th17- and Tfh17-cells were hardly detectable. However, the residual CCR6+T-cells contained Th1/17- and CCR6SPT-cells that proliferated in vivo. They produced high amounts of IL-10, indicating that, unexpectedly, IL-10 production by human T-cells is STAT3-independent in vivo. Intriguingly, opportunistic pathogens selectively activated CCR6+T-cells in AD-HIES patients to produce IL-10. Opportunistic bacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis induced in addition IL-2 and IFN-γ. We conclude that Th17 differentiation is not completely impaired in the absence of STAT3 signalling but arrested at an early stage of CCR6+TCM. These pre-Th17-cells produce IL-10 and require STAT3 to differentiate to Th17-cells and to fight extracellular pathogens but could directly generate Th1/17-cells to contain intracellular bacteria. Significance AD-HIES patients have impaired STAT3 signalling, lack consequently Th17-cells and experience recurrent infections with opportunistic extracellular pathogens. These patients were key to the dogma that Th17-cells control extracellular pathogens, but T-cell responses to these pathogens have surprisingly never been analyzed. Here, we report that Th17 differentiation in response to opportunistic extracellular pathogens in the absence of STAT3 signalling is arrested at an early stage of pre-Th17-cells that produce high levels of IL-10. These otherwise non-polarised T-cells acquired IFN-gamma production with IL-12 that could enable them to contain intracellular bacteria. These surprising findings demonstrates that Th17 differentiation is not completely blocked in the absence of STAT3 signalling, and that IL-10 production by human T-cells is STAT3-independent in vivo.">

        <tr id="Anti-Lag3 and anti-PD-1 combination immunotherapy for melanoma has received recent regulatory approval, yet its mechanism of action is unclear, particularly for CD4+ T cells. Here, we determined the roles of the Lag3 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways during CD4+ T cell activation in vivo. During primary immune responses, Lag3 played a redundant role with the PD1/PD-L1 axis dominant in regulating early CD4+ T cell activation. By exploiting an adaptive tolerance model, we reveal that Lag3 and PD-L1 co-blockade (CB) drove major changes in CD4+ T cells, resulting in a transcriptional profile dominated by a hybrid T follicular helper (Tfh)/Th17 cell phenotype. Mechanistically, CB enhanced T cell receptor (TCR) signal duration, thereby inducing an NFAT-biased transcriptional motif, previously linked to positive clinical outcomes for melanoma patients. Additionally, CB synergistically upregulated CCR6, leading to enhanced CCL20-mediated CD4+ T cell migration. Analysis of melanoma patients on anti-PD-1 pathway immunotherapies revealed that tumour CCR6 expression stratifies clinical outcomes and effector memory CD4+ T cells upregulate CCR6 in patients on anti-PD-1 and anti-Lag3 combination immunotherapy. Our data reveal that Lag3 and PD-1 pathways have context dependent roles in regulating the activation and migration of CD4+ T cells and highlights CCR6 as a biomarker for immunotherapy responses.">

        <tr id="Alcelaphine gammaherpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1) asymptomatically persists in its natural host, the wildebeest. However, cross-species transmission to cattle results in the induction of an acute and lethal peripheral T cell lymphoma-like disease (PTCL), named malignant catarrhal fever (MCF). Our previous findings demonstrated an essential role for viral genome maintenance in infected CD8+ T lymphocytes but the exact mechanism(s) leading to lymphoproliferation and MCF remained unknown. To decipher how AlHV-1 dysregulates T lymphocytes, we first examined the global phenotypic changes in circulating CD8+ T cells after experimental infection of calves. T cell receptor repertoire together with transcriptomics and epigenomics analyses demonstrated an oligoclonal expansion of infected CD8+ T cells displaying effector and exhaustion gene signatures, including GZMA, GNLY, PD-1, and TOX2 expression. Then, among viral genes expressed in infected CD8+ T cells, we uncovered A10 that encodes a transmembrane signaling protein displaying multiple tyrosine residues, with predicted ITAM and SH3 motifs. Impaired A10 expression did not affect AlHV-1 replication in vitro but rendered AlHV-1 unable to induce MCF. Furthermore, A10 was phosphorylated in T lymphocytes in vitro and affected T cell signaling. Finally, while AlHV-1 mutants expressing mutated forms of A10 devoid of ITAM or SH3 motifs (or both) were able to induce MCF, a recombinant virus expressing a mutated form of A10 unable to phosphorylate its tyrosine residues resulted in the lack of MCF and protected against a wild-type virus challenge. Thus, we could characterize the nature of this γ-herpesvirus-induced PTCL-like disease and identify an essential mechanism explaining its development.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells have emerged as a ground-breaking therapy for the treatment of hematological malignancies due to their capacity for rapid tumor-specific killing and long-lasting tumor immunity. However, the same success has not been observed in patients with solid tumors. Largely, this is due to the additional challenges imposed by safe and uniform target selection, inefficient CAR T-cell access to sites of disease and the presence of a hostile immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.


AREAS COVERED
Literature was reviewed on the PubMed database from the first description of a CAR by Kuwana, Kurosawa and colleagues in December 1987 through to the present day. This literature indicates that in order to tackle solid tumors, CAR T-cells can be further engineered with additional armoring strategies that facilitate trafficking to and infiltration of malignant lesions together with reversal of suppressive immune checkpoints that operate within solid tumor lesions.


EXPERT OPINION
In this review, we describe a number of recent advances in CAR T-cell technology that set out to combat the problems imposed by solid tumors including tumor recruitment, infiltration, immunosuppression, metabolic compromise, and hypoxia.">

        <tr id="Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a multifaceted condition characterized by significant diversity in its molecular and pathological subtypes and clinical manifestation. Despite the progress made in the treatment of DLBCL through the development of novel drugs, an estimated one-third of patients encounter relapse or acquire refractory disease. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of DLBCL, a complex network consisting of cellular and noncellular components that engage in interactions with the tumor, is a parameter that is gaining increasing attention. The TME comprises both the immune and nonimmune microenvironments. The immune microenvironment comprises natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and T and B lymphocytes. The nonimmune microenvironment consists of the extracellular matrix (ECM), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), mesenchymal stromal cells, and other molecules that are secreted. Despite ongoing research, the exact impact of these components and their interaction on the progression of the disease remains elusive. A comprehensive review of significant discoveries concerning the cellular and noncellular constituents, molecular characteristics, and treatment response and prognosis of the TME in DLBCL, as well as the potential targeting of the TME with novel therapeutic approaches, is provided in this article.">

        <tr id="We have undertaken this review to explore the various developments and insights of CAR-T cell therapy during 1989-2023 and its advantages in the treatment of cancer and immune modulation. It is a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, which is an innovative form of immunotherapy that harnesses the power of the immune system to fight cancer. At first, T cells are extracted from the patient’s blood through a process called leukapheresis. Then the modification has been done in T cells by genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on their surface. These receptors are designed to recognize specific proteins, or antigens, that are found on the surface of cancer cells. Many conventional therapies available in the market for the treatment of cancer and Immuno modulation but most of them having Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR). But CAR-T cells possess upper hand on these conventional Formulations. Once a sufficient number of CAR-T cells have been produced, they are infused back into the patient’s bloodstream. Once reach inside the body, the CAR-T cells recognize and bind to the cancer cells that express the specific antigen targeted by the CAR. This triggers the destruction of the cancer cells by the immune system. CAR-T cell therapy has shown remarkable success in treating certain types of blood cancers, such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), and certain types of lymphoma. The content of this review will pave the way to work on CAR-T cell therapy.

        <tr id="Background and aims Patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma(r/r aBCL)who progressed after CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CD19CART) had a poor prognosis. Application of CAR T-cells targeting a second different antigen (CD20) expressed on the surface of B-cell lymphoma as subsequent anti-cancer salvage therapy (CD20-SD-CART) is also an option. This study aimed to evaluate the survival outcome of CD20-SD-CART as a salvage therapy for CD19 CART treatment failure. Methods This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients with aBCL after the failure of CD19 CART treatment at Beijing Gobroad Boren Hospital from December 2019 to May 2022. Patients were subsequently treated with CD20CART therapy or non-CART therapy (polatuzumab or non-polatuzumab). Results A total of 93 patients were included in the study, with 54 patients receiving CD20-SD-CART therapy. After a median follow-up of 18.54 months, the CD20-SD-CART group demonstrated significantly longer median progression-free survival (4.04 months vs. 2.27 months, p=0.0032) and median overall survival (8.15 months vs. 3.02 months, p<0.0001) compared to the non-CART group. The complete response rate in the CD20-SD-CART group (15/54, 27.8%) was also significantly higher than the non-CART group (3/38, 7.9%, p=0.03). Multivariate analysis further confirmed that CD20CART treatment was independently associated with improved overall survival (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.16–0.51; p<0.0001) and progression-free survival (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27–0.8; p=0.005). Conclusion CD20-SD-CART could serve as an effective therapeutic option for patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma after CD19CART treatment failure.">

        <tr id="The development of CAR-T-cell immunotherapy has notably elevated the efficacy of treating multiple myeloma. Currently, a variety of targets, including BCMA, CS1, CD38, FcRH5, and GPRC5D, are being investigated. Despite these significant advancements, challenges such as antigen escape, limited persistence of CAR-T cells, and the intricate nature of the tumor microenvironment persist, leading to relapses following treatment.We report the case of a patient with recurrent and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who developed a substantial extramedullary plasmacytoma in the muscles of the lower limb following multiple rounds of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The patient underwent CAR-T-cell immunotherapy targeting BCMA and CS1; however, the tumor progressed despite treatment. Surgical resection of the extramedullary plasmacytoma was subsequently performed. Upon comparison of the tumor tissue with the adjacent tissue, increased expression of MYBL2 was noted in the tumor tissue, potentially contributing to the lack of improvement in extramedullary relapse after dual-targeted CAR-T cell therapy.In patients with recurrent and refractory multiple myeloma who underwent multiple cycles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, dual-targeted CAR-T cell therapy aimed at BCMA and CS1 failed to effectively manage extramedullary relapse. Elevated expression of MYBL2 in multiple myeloma correlates with a poorer prognosis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis should be offered disease-modifying therapies as part of their management. Recommended options include integrin antagonist therapy including natalizumab as well as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies like, ocrelizumab, rituximab, ofatumumab, and ublituximab. These therapies reduce relapse rates and slow brain lesion accumulation. Disease-modifying therapies selection may depend on patient preferences, potential fetal harm, and specific drug risks, requiring continuous monitoring via tracking clinical relapses and new MRI brain lesions. Natalizumab carries a risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, particularly in anti-JCV antibody-positive patients, necessitating regular monitoring. Ocrelizumab, rituximab, and ublituximab are associated with an increased risk of infections (especially respiratory and skin infections), infusion reactions, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Ocrelizumab additionally poses a heightened risk of immune-mediated colitis and breast cancer, and it is contraindicated for patients with active hepatitis B due to the risk of viral reactivation. Ublituximab has been noted to be linked to potential fetal harm. We report the case of a 42-year-old male with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis on ocrelizumab who developed persistent fever and shortness of breath, two weeks after his last ocrelizumab dose. Despite antibiotic treatment for suspected pneumonia, his symptoms persisted. A chest CT scan revealed multifocal ground-glass opacities suggestive of organizing pneumonia, likely secondary to ocrelizumab. The patient's condition improved with high-dose corticosteroids, underscoring the importance of vigilance for extremely rare ocrelizumab-associated pulmonary side effects and the need for prompt, appropriate intervention.">

        <tr id="Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection poses significant risks in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients. Despite advances in antiviral therapies, issues such as drug resistance, side effects, and inadequate immune reconstitution remain. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adoptive cell therapy (ATC) in managing CMV infections in allo-HSCT recipients. Adhering to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive database search through July 2023. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on studies involving HSCT patients with CMV infections treated with ATC. The primary outcome was the response rate to ATC, and secondary outcomes included adverse events associated with ATC. The Freeman-Tukey transformation was applied for analysis. In the meta-analysis of 40 studies involving 953 participants, ATC achieved an overall integrated response rate of 90.16%, with a complete response of 82.59% and a partial response of 22.95%. ATC source, HLA matching, steroid intake, and age group markedly influenced response rates. Donor-derived T-cell treatments exhibited a higher response rate (93.66%) compared to third-party sources (88.94%). HLA-matched patients demonstrated a response rate of 92.90%, while mismatched patients had a lower rate. Children showed a response rate of 83.40%, while adults had a notably higher rate of 98.46%. Adverse events were minimal, with graft-versus-host disease occurring in 24.32% of patients. ATC shows promising response rates in treating CMV infections post-HSCT, with an acceptable safety profile. However, to establish its efficacy conclusively and compare it with other antiviral treatments, randomised controlled trials are essential. Further research should prioritise such trials over observational and one-arm studies to provide robust evidence for clinical decision-making.">

 Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is commonly associated with alterations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene, resulting in upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor pathways. Immune checkpoint inhibitors and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors are the mainstays of systemic treatment for metastatic RCC; however, most patients encounter disease progression after the initial response. The phase 3 clinical trial LITESPARK-005–belzutifan (HIF-2α inhibitor) demonstrated improvement in progression-free survival compared with everolimus in heavily pretreated patients unselected for somatic/germline VHL alterations (an objective response rate of 23% and a median time on therapy of 7.6 months in the belzutifan cohort), resulting in U.S. FDA approval for patients with advanced RCC. Herein, we present two cases of refractory metastatic RCC (including one with brain metastases) with somatic VHL mutations who received belzutifan after discussion in the institutional Molecular Tumor Board. Both patients had an excellent clinical response (partial remissions ongoing at >12 and >20 months). Future studies should assess the merits of biomarker selection for belzutifan treatment.">

        <tr id="Memory T cells are conventionally associated with durable recall responses. In our longitudinal analyses of CD4+ T cell responses to the yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccine by peptide-MHC tetramers, we unexpectedly found CD45RO-CCR7+ virus-specific CD4+ T cells that expanded shortly after vaccination and persisted months to years after immunization. Further phenotypic analyses revealed the presence of stem-cell memory T cells (TSCM) within this subset. In addition, post-vaccine T cells lacking known memory markers and functionally resembling genuine naïve T cells were identified, referred to herein as marker-negative T cells (TMN). Single-cell TCR sequencing detected expanded clonotypes within the TMN subset and identified TMN TCRs shared with memory and effector T cells. Longitudinal tracking of YFV-specific responses over subsequent years revealed superior stability of TMN cells, which correlated with the longevity of the overall tetramer+ population. These findings uncovered additional complexity within the post-immune T cell compartment and implicate TMN cells in durable immune responses.">

        <tr id="Developing vaccines that promote CD8+ T cell memory is a challenge for infectious disease and cancer immunotherapy. TCF-1+ stem cell-like memory T (TSCM) cells are important determinants of long-lived memory. Yet, the developmental requirements for TSCM formation are unclear. Here, we identify the temporal window for type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor (IFNAR) blockade to drive TSCM cell generation. TSCM cells were transcriptionally distinct and emerged from a transitional precursor of exhausted (TPEX) cellular state concomitant with viral clearance. TSCM differentiation correlated with T cell retention within the lymph node paracortex, due to increased CXCR3 chemokine abundance which disrupted gradient formation. These affects were due a counterintuitive increase in IFNψ, which controlled cell location. Combining IFNAR inhibition with mRNA-LNP vaccination promoted specific TSCM differentiation and enhanced protection against chronic infection. These finding propose a new approach to vaccine design whereby modulation of inflammation promotes memory formation and function. HIGHLIGHTS Early, transient inhibition of the type I interferon (IFN) receptor (IFNAR) during acute viral infection promotes stem cell-like memory T (TSCM) cell differentiation without establishing chronic infection. TSCM and precursor of exhausted (TPEX) cellular states are distinguished transcriptionally and by cell surface markers. Developmentally, TSCM cell differentiation occurs via a transition from a TPEX state coinciding with viral clearance. Transient IFNAR blockade increases IFNψ production to modulate the ligands of CXCR3 and couple TSCM differentiation to cell retention within the T cell paracortex of the lymph node. Specific promotion of TSCM cell differentiation with nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccination elicits enhanced protection against chronic viral challenge.">

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results in immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing beta cells I the pancreas. B cells have been identified as critical antigen presenting cells and their specificity drives disease progression. More recently, they have also been shown to have the capacity to develop into suppressive, regulatory B cells that ameliorate autoimmune disease in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. In these models, signaling through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) drives a glycolytic flux that facilitates expansion of regulatory B cells. Here we examine the relationship between B cell development, cellular metabolism, and HIF-1α to reveal that in a mouse model of autoimmune diabetes, B cells have distinct metabolic characteristics that change with disease progression. Further, response to hypoxia in autoimmune B cells is distinct from the response by non-autoimmune control B cells. Together, these data suggest that dysregulated HIF signaling may drive T1D progression and activation of HIF-1α to expand regulatory B cell populations may be a viable option for immune modulation.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
CD8+ T regulatory (Treg) cells that recognize the nonclassical class 1b molecule Qa-1/human leukocyte antigen E (Q/E CD8+ Treg cells) are important in maintaining self-tolerance. We sought to investigate the role that these T cells play in type 1 diabetes (T1D) pathogenesis and whether an intervention targeting this mechanism may delay T1D progression.


METHODS
We conducted a phase 1/2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the autologous dendritic cell therapy AVT001 that included participants at least 16 years of age, within 1 year of T1D diagnosis, and with ex vivo evidence of a defect in Q/E CD8+ Treg function. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to AVT001 or placebo, which was administered in three monthly intravenous infusions. The primary end point was safety; efficacy end points included changes from baseline in C-peptide area under the curve (AUC) during a 4-hour mixed meal, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and insulin dose.


RESULTS
Sixteen patients received AVT001, and nine received placebo. Similar rates and severity of adverse events were observed in both groups. None of the patients in the AVT001 group had serious adverse events through visit day 360. Compared with placebo, treatment with ATV001 was associated with less decline from baseline log-transformed C-peptide AUC (nmol/l), with the treatment effect between AVT001 and placebo at day 150 of 0.09 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to 0.15) and at day 360 of 0.10 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.15). No clear differences in change in HbA1c and insulin dose from baseline were observed between groups. Estimated treatment effects of AVT001 versus placebo at day 360 were -0.17% (95% CI, -0.60 to 0.26%) for HbA1c and -0.06 U/kg/day (95% CI, -0.14 to 0.02) for daily insulin dose.


CONCLUSIONS
In this phase 1/2 trial, AVT001 did not result in dose-limiting adverse events. Potential signals of efficacy observed here warrant further evaluation in a fully powered trial.

        <tr id="Although immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has shown promise in colorectal cancer patients with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), response rates remain low for the majority of patients. Key challenges include the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells and the presence of immunosuppressive cells within the tumor microenvironment. By integrating digital spatial profiling and scRNA sequencing, we found that the tumor-intrinsic activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was strongly correlated with the heterogeneity and exhaustion of CD8+ T cells within the spatial context of the tumor microenvironment and correlated with patient survival. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic loss of FAK enhanced antitumor immune responses and synergistically potentiated αPD-1 and αTIM-3 immunotherapy by augmenting CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity and restoring exhaustion in preclinical models of colorectal cancer. Mechanistically, nuclear FAK was found to regulate SP1/IL-6-mediated T cell exhaustion and the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. These findings underscore FAK’s pivotal role in CD8+ T cell exhaustion within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, suggesting that FAK is a promising target for advancing cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
The treatment landscape of polycythemia vera (PV) has seen major advancements within the last decade including approval of ruxolitinib in the second line setting after hydroxyurea, ropegylated interferon-α2b, and advanced clinical development of a novel class of agents called hepcidin mimetics.


AREAS COVERED
We provide a comprehensive review of the evidence discussing the risk stratification, treatment indications, role and limitations of phlebotomy only approach and pivotal trials covering nuances related to the use of interferon-α (IFN-α), ruxolitinib, hepcidin mimetics and upcoming investigational agents including HDAC and LSD1 inhibitors.


EXPERT OPINION
The research paradigm in PV is slowly shifting from the sole focus on hematocrit control and moving toward disease modification. The discovery of hepcidin mimetics has come as a breakthrough in restoring iron homeostasis, achieving phlebotomy-independence and may lead to improved thrombosis-free survival with stricter hematocrit control. On the other hand, emerging data with IFN- α and ruxolitinib as well as combination of the two agents suggests the potential for achieving molecular remission in a subset of PV patients and long-term follow-up is awaited to validate the correlation of molecular responses with clinically relevant outcomes of progression-free and thrombosis-free survival.">

        <tr id="Monoclonal antibody (MoAb) therapy has been increasingly used in recent years for hematologic malignancies. The MoAbs anti-CD38 and anti-CD47 are immunoglobulins directed against epitopes that are highly expressed not only on cancer cells, but also on red blood cells (RBCs), as well as platelets. Additionally, producing an off-target effect interferes in pre-transfusion testing, having the potential to unchain hemolytic anemia. Blood banks must assure the availability and safety of blood products for patients in need. Thus, MoAbs have become a challenge for blood banks, since methods to overcome interferences must be adopted. Several strategies have been proposed to mitigate pan-reactivity in pre-transfusion indirect antiglobulin tests, such as the treatment of reagent RBCs with enzymes or reducing agents, allogeneic RBC adsorptions, and drug-specific neutralization assays. All of these have some kind of limitation. This review summarizes the interferences of MoAbs in pre-transfusion testing, focusing on the available strategies to mitigate them in order to provide a safe transfusion.">

        <tr id="In recent years, immunotherapy has emerged as a crucial component of cancer treatment. However, its efficacy remains limited across various cancer types, highlighting unmet needs. Poliovirus receptor-related 2 (PVRL2) and Poliovirus receptor (PVR) are members of the Nectin and Nectin-like Molecules family, known for their role as cell-cell adhesion molecules. With the development of immunotherapy, their involvement in tumor immune mechanisms as immune checkpoint factors has garnered significant attention. PVRL2 and PVR are predominantly expressed on tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells, binding to PVRIG and TIGIT, respectively, which are primarily found on T and NK cells, thereby suppressing antitumor immunity. Notably, gynecological cancers such as ovarian and endometrial cancers exhibit high expression levels of PVRL2 and PVR, with similar trends observed in various other solid and hematologic tumors. Targeting these immune checkpoint pathways offers a promising therapeutic avenue, potentially in combination with existing treatments. However, the immunomodulatory mechanism involving these bindings, known as the DNAM-1 axis, is complex, underscoring the importance of understanding it for developing novel therapies. This article comprehensively reviews the immunomodulatory mechanisms centered on PVRL2 and PVR, elucidating their implications for various cancer types.">

        <tr id="Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR T) cell therapy targeting the CD19 antigen represents a significant advancement in the treatment of various subtypes of CD19-expressing hematologic malignancies. Nevertheless, the current commercial CAR T manufacturing process is intricate, time-consuming, and costly, involving a supply chain that initiates at the treating center with mononuclear cell apheresis, followed by cryopreservation and shipping to and from a centralized third-party manufacturing facility. This process can introduce treatment delays due to logistical requirements. We hypothesized that point-of-care (POC) manufacturing of CAR T cells could reduce vein to vein time which is one of the major challenges with commercial CAR T processes. This study presents the outcomes of large-scale, clinical-grade, in-house POC CAR T manufacturing, including assessments of transduction efficiency, vector copy number, phenotype, and effector function of CAR T cells. Utilizing the CliniMACS Prodigy system, we processed mononuclear cells from fresh leukapheresis harvests of healthy donors. The cells underwent automated processing and activation with TransAct, a polymeric nanomatrix activation reagent containing CD3/CD28-specific antibodies. Following activation, the cells were transduced and expanded in the Centricult-unit under stabilized conditions, with automated feeding and media exchange. For transduction, we employed the Miltenyi Lentigen third-generation lentiviral vector, which delivers a second-generation CD19 CAR construct with a 4-1BB costimulatory domain and TNFRSF19 transmembrane domain. Our POC manufacturing data demonstrated the successful generation of large-scale CAR T cells, sufficient to prepare multiple doses within a shortened production period of 9 days, followed by cryopreservation for quality control assessment and batch certification for patient infusion. The transduction efficiencies, phenotype, and function of the Lentigen CD19 CAR T cells were comparable to previously published procedures, with overall T-cell yields sufficient for therapeutic application. CAR expression was evaluated by flow cytometry and vector copy number. In-process testing ensured the quality and suitability of CAR T cells in terms of sterility and cell number for the desired dose preparations. The final product was also subjected for the assessment of any replicative competent lentivirus. CAR-mediated target cell killing was assessed via co-culture assays, and cytokine release was measured by ELISA. To evaluate the shelf life of the cryopreserved product, stability and viability were checked at approximately 6 and 12 months. Our results indicate that in-house POC manufacturing at King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre (KFSH&RC) enables regulatory-compliant production of CAR T cells, eliminating the need for third-party shipping logistics.">

        <tr id="Abstract To investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with targeting CD30-expressing Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and immune checkpoint modulation induced by combination therapies of CTLA4 and PD1, we leveraged Phase 1/2 multicenter open-label trial NCT01896999 that enrolled patients with refractory or relapsed HL (R/R HL). Using peripheral blood, we assessed soluble proteins, cell composition, T-cell clonality, and tumor antigen-specific antibodies in 54 patients enrolled in the phase 1 component of the trial. NCT01896999 reported high (>75%) overall objective response rates with brentuximab vedotin (BV) in combination with ipilimumab (I) and/or nivolumab (N) in patients with R/R HL. We observed a durable increase in soluble PD1 and plasmacytoid dendritic cells as well as decreases in plasma CCL17, ANGPT2, MMP12, IL13, and CXCL13 in N-containing regimens (BV + N and BV + I + N) compared with BV + I (P < 0.05). Nonresponders and patients with short progression-free survival showed elevated CXCL9, CXCL13, CD5, CCL17, adenosine–deaminase, and MUC16 at baseline or after one treatment cycle and a higher prevalence of NY-ESO-1-specific autoantibodies (P < 0.05). The results suggest a circulating tumor-immune-derived signature of BV ± I ± N treatment resistance that may be useful for patient stratification in combination checkpoint therapy. Significance: Identification of multi-omic immune markers from peripheral blood may help elucidate resistance mechanisms to checkpoint inhibitor and antibody–drug conjugate combinations with potential implications for treatment decisions in relapsed HL.">

 Undifferentiated round cell tumours (URCTs) are rare and less researched Ewing-like mesenchymal tumours that primarily affect bones and soft tissues. Therapeutic options for advanced URCT are limited. Pazopanib, a multi-tyrosine kinase and angiogenesis inhibitor, is currently used for managing advanced soft-tissue sarcoma. However, its efficacy in the treatment of URCT remains uncertain and has not been established. In this study, we have cultured and characterised a patient-derived URCT cell line to understand the in vitro growth properties and anti-cancer agent sensitivity.



 Primary cell culture was performed by mechanical and enzymatic dissociation of URCT tissue specimens to derive a cell line. Morphology, growth properties and immunological features characterised the cells. Further, the in vitro sensitivity for clinically used anti-cancer drugs was evaluated.



 The URCT cell line was established from a high-grade round-cell tumour patient. The cells had mesenchymal morphology and showed cyclin B3 (CCNB3) positivity, which was confirmed in the tissue from the patient. The cells exhibited an anchorage-independent growth property and aggregated to form spheroids in a non-adherent in vitro system. Anti-cancer agents vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide and pazopanib inhibited URCT cell proliferation. Pazopanib exhibited cytotoxic action in URCT cells, leading to cell death.



 This is an early report of cultured URCT cells expressing CCNB3, studied in vitro. The patient-derived model suggests the efficacy of pazopanib in URCT cells. The characterised line will be helpful to advance sarcoma studies.

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
CXCR4/CXCL12 axis regulates cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation, as well as the homing and mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from bone marrow niches to the peripheral blood. Furthermore, CXCR4 and CXCL12 are key mediators of cross-talk between hematological malignancies and their microenvironments. CXCR4 overexpression drives disease progression, boosts tumor cell survival, and promotes chemoresistance, leading to poor prognosis.


AREAS COVERED
In light of these discoveries, scientific investigations and clinical trials have underscored the therapeutic promise found in small-molecule antagonists like plerixafor, peptides/peptidomimetics such as BKT140, monoclonal antibodies like PF-06747143 and ulocuplumab, as well as microRNAs. Their efficacy is evident in reducing tumor burden, inducing apoptosis, and sensitizing malignant cells to conventional chemotherapies. This overview delves into the pathogenic role of the CXC4/CXCL12 axis in hematological neoplasms and examines the clinical application of key CXCR4 antagonists.


EXPERT OPINION
The information collectively emphasizes the potential of CXCR4 antagonists as a therapeutic strategy for hematologic malignancies, showcasing advancements in preclinical and clinical studies. As these therapeutic strategies progress through clinical trials, their potential to reshape the prognosis of hematologic malignancies will become increasingly apparent.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological cancer marked by plasma cell accumulation in the bone marrow. Despite treatment advancements, MM remains incurable in most patients. MM-associated immune dysregulation fosters disease progression, prompting research into immunotherapy to combat the disease. An area of immunotherapy investigation is the design of myeloma vaccine therapy to reverse tumor-associated immune suppression and elicit tumor-specific immune responses to effectively target MM cells. This article reviews vaccine immunotherapy for MM, categorizing findings by antigen type and delivery method. Antigens include idiotype (Id), tumor-associated (TAA), tumor-specific (TSA), and whole tumor lysate. Myeloma vaccination has so far shown limited clinical efficacy. However, further studies are essential to optimize various aspects, including antigen and patient selection, vaccine timing and sequencing, and rational combinations with emerging MM treatments.">

        <tr id="Antigen presentation is a crucial mechanism that drives the T cell-mediated immune response and the development of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Genetic alterations within the highly variable Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II (MHC II) have been proven to result in significant changes in the molecular basis of antigen presentation and the clinical course of patients with both Adult-Onset MS (AOMS) and Pediatric-Onset MS (POMS). Among the numerous polymorphisms of the Human Leucocyte Antigens (HLA), within MHC II complex, HLA-DRB1*15:01 has been labeled, in Caucasian ethnic groups, as a high-risk allele for MS due to the ability of its structure to increase affinity to Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) epitopes. This characteristic, among others, in the context of the trimolecular complex or immunological synapsis, provides the foundation for autoimmunity triggered by environmental or endogenous factors. As with all professional antigen presenting cells, macrophages are characterized by the expression of MHC II and are often implicated in the formation of MS lesions. Increased presence of M1 macrophages in MS patients has been associated both with progression and onset of the disease, each involving separate but similar mechanisms. In this critical narrative review, we focus on macrophages, discussing how HLA genetic alterations can promote dysregulation of this population’s homeostasis in the periphery and the Central Nervous System (CNS). We also explore the potential interconnection in observed pathological macrophage mechanisms and the function of the diverse structure of HLA alleles in neurodegenerative CNS, seen in MS, by comparing available clinical with molecular data through the prism of HLA-immunogenetics. Finally, we discuss available and experimental pharmacological approaches for MS targeting the trimolecular complex that are based on cell phenotype modulation and HLA genotype involvement and try to reveal fertile ground for the potential development of novel drugs.">

        <tr id="Background: Solid organ transplantation is hindered by immune-mediated chronic graft dysfunction and the side effects of immunosuppressive therapy. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are crucial for modulating immune responses post-transplantation; however, the transfer of polyspecific Tregs alone is insufficient to induce allotolerance in rodent models. Methods: To enhance the efficacy of adoptive Treg therapy, we investigated different immune interventions in the recipients. By utilizing an immunogenic skin transplant model and existing transplantation medicine reagents, we facilitated the clinical translation of our findings. Specifically, antigen-specific Tregs were used. Results: Our study demonstrated that combining the available induction therapies with drug-induced T-cell proliferation due to lymphopenia effectively increased the Treg/T effector ratios. This results in significant Treg accumulation within the graft, leading to long-term tolerance after the transfer of antigen-specific Tregs. Importantly, all the animals achieved operational tolerance, which boosted the presence of adoptively transferred Tregs within the graft. Conclusions: This protocol offers a means to establish tolerance by utilizing antigen-specific Tregs. These results have promising implications for future trials involving adoptive Treg therapy in organ transplantation.">

        <tr id="A first-in-human trial demonstrated that a vaccine targeting the histone mutation H3K27M can induce an immune response, in a mutation-specific manner, in patients with diffuse midline glioma. In a recent study by Boschert et al., the same group now dissects the functional immune response triggered after effective vaccination of one of the patients, who has been in remission for over 3 years. The H3K27M peptide vaccine, named H3-vac, induces a CD4+ T-cell-specific immune response in this patient and expands the repertoire of polyclonal H3K27M-specific T-cell receptors. A clonal H3K27M-reactive B-cell population was also detected in the patient's cerebrospinal fluid. Importantly, the immune response is induced across various human leukocyte antigen alleleotypes, indicating the potential efficacy of the vaccine in diverse populations. By exploring in detail the immune response linked to this patient's long-term survival, the authors prove peptide vaccinations as a viable therapeutic approach. This paves the way for personalised therapies harnessing immunogenic T- and B-cell responses against different tumour types.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in children. Although new chemotherapeutic approaches have improved ocular salvage rates, novel therapies are required for patients with refractory intraocular and metastatic disease. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting glypican-2 (GPC2) are a potential new therapeutic strategy.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
GPC2 expression and its regulation by the E2F1 transcription factor were studied in retinoblastoma patient samples and cellular models. In vitro, we performed functional studies comparing GPC2 CAR T-cells with different co-stimulatory domains (4-1BB and CD28). In vivo, the efficacy of local and systemic administration of GPC2 CAR T-cells were evaluated in intraocular and leptomeningeal human retinoblastoma xenograft models.


RESULTS
Retinoblastoma tumors, but not healthy retinal tissues, expressed cell surface GPC2 and this tumor-specific expression was driven by E2F1. GPC2-directed CARs with 4-1BB co-stimulation (GPC2.BBz) were superior to CARs with CD28 stimulatory domains (GPC2.28z), efficiently inducing retinoblastoma cell cytotoxicity and enhancing T-cell proliferation and polyfunctionality. In vivo, GPC2.BBz CARs had enhanced persistence that led to significant tumor regression compared to either control CD19 or GPC2.28z CARs. In intraocular models, GPC2.BBz CAR T-cells efficiently trafficked to tumor-bearing eyes after intravitreal or systemic infusions, significantly prolonging ocular survival. In central nervous system (CNS) retinoblastoma models, intraventricular or systemically administered GPC2.BBz CAR T-cells were activated in retinoblastoma-involved CNS tissues, resulting in robust tumor regression with substantially extended overall mouse survival.


CONCLUSIONS
GPC2-directed CAR T-cells are effective against intraocular and CNS metastatic retinoblastomas.">

        <tr id="Promising outcomes have been reported in elder patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using combined therapy of venetoclax (VEN) and azacytidine (AZA) in recent years. However, approximately one-third of patients appear to be refractory to this therapy. Vitamin K2 (VK2) shows apoptosis-inducing activity in AML cells, and daily oral VK2 (menaquinone-4, GlakayR) has been approved for patients with osteoporosis in Japan. We observed a high response rate to AZA plus VEN therapy, with no 8-week mortality in the newly diagnosed AML patients consuming daily VK2 in our hospital. The median age of the patients was 75.9 years (range 66–84) with high-risk features. Patients received AZA 75 mg/m2 on D1-7, VEN 400 mg on D1-28, and daily VK2 45 mg. The CR/CRi ratio was 94.7% (18/19), with a CR rate of 79%. Complete cytogenetic CR was achieved in 15 of 19 (79%) patients, and MRD negativity in 2 of 15 (13%) evaluable CR patients. Owing to the extremely high response rate in clinical settings, we further attempted to investigate the underlying mechanisms. The combination of VK2 and VEN synergistically induced apoptosis in all five AML cell lines tested. VK2, but not VEN, induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the transcriptional upregulation of NOXA, followed by MCL-1 repression. ROS scavengers repressed VK2 induced-NOXA expression and led to the cancellation of pronounced apoptosis and the downregulation of MCL-1 by VK2 plus VEN. Additionally, knockdown and knockout of NOXA resulted in abrogation of the MCL-1 repression as well as enhanced cytotoxicity by the two-drug combination, indicating that VK2 suppresses MCL-1 via ROS-mediated NOXA induction. These data suggest that the dual inhibition of BCL-2 by VEN and MCL-1 by VK2 is responsible for the remarkable clinical outcomes in our patients. Therefore, large-scale clinical trials are required.">

        <tr id="Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) constitutes 10% of lung cancer. It is the leading cause of death due to cancer in men and the second most prevalent cause of cancer related death in women worldwide. It is an extremely hostile tumor with early development, spread, and fatal as it is typically found too late. Early-stage patients are usually treated with chemotherapy and thoracic radiation and surgery is rarely used to treat this malignancy. The addition of immunotherapy to first-line chemotherapy has improved survival for the first time in the decennary. It has demonstrated promise in producing significant, long-lasting responses. The disease is still challenging to treat but adding radiation therapy to a patient's care at certain intervals may enhance illness control. Platinum-based chemotherapy is initially quite effective, eliciting prompt and often substantial responses, however, they are transient effects, and when SCLC recurs, treatment resistance is strong.">

        <tr id="Introduction Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (ATG) is a cornerstone in immune suppression for solid organ transplantation. The treatment is a delicate balance between complications arising from over-immunosuppression such as infections and cancer versus rejection stemming from under-immunosuppression. CD3+ T-lymphocyte measurements are frequently employed for treatment monitoring. However, this analysis is costly and not always accessible. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the total count of lymphocytes could replace CD3+ T-lymphocyte measurements based on data from our transplantation center combined with a review of the literature. The hypothesis was that the total lymphocyte count could serve as a diagnostic surrogate marker for CD3+ T-lymphocytes. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including patients who underwent kidney and/or a pancreas transplantation and received ATG as induction therapy or for rejection treatment. The inclusion criterium was that the total lymphocyte count and CD3+ T-lymphocyte measurements were measured simultaneously on the same day. Additionally, PubMed and Embase were searched up to 18/10/2023 for published studies on solid organ transplantation, ATG, T-lymphocytes, lymphocyte count, and monitoring. In the retrospective cohort study, a total of 91 patients transplanted between 2016 and 2023, with 487 samples, were included. Results Total lymphocyte counts below 0.3 x 109/L had a high sensitivity (86%) as a surrogate marker of CD3+ T-lymphocytes below 0.05 x 109/L, but the specificity was low (52%) for total lymphocyte counts above 0.3 x 109/L as a surrogate marker for CD3+ T-lymphocytes above 0.05 x 109/L. A review of the literature identified seven studies comparing total lymphocyte counts and CD3+ T-lymphocytes in ATG monitoring. These studies supported the use of a low total lymphocyte count as a surrogate marker for CD3+ T-lymphocytes and an indicator to omit ATG treatment. However, there was no consensus regarding high total lymphocyte counts as an indicator for continued treatment. Discussion Results supports that the total lymphocyte count can be used to omit ATG treatment when below 0.3 x 109/L whereas the CD3+ T-lymphocyte analysis should be reserved for higher total lymphocyte counts to avoid ATG overtreatment.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (PCSM-LPD) is an increasingly recognized entity with heterogeneous management strategies that may include radiotherapy.


OBJECTIVE
Our aim was to characterize treatment options for PCSM-LPD, with a focus on the role of radiotherapy.


METHODS
This is a retrospective review of 46 patients seen in the Cutaneous Lymphoma Program at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, with a clinicopathologic review consistent with PCSM-LPD. All patients were biopsied and underwent observation, topical/intralesional steroids, and/or radiotherapy. Patients were confirmed to have residual disease prior to radiotherapy.


RESULTS
All patients achieved a complete response (CR). Sixteen patients (35%) received focal radiotherapy, with a CR in 15 (94%). The CR rate following ultra-low-dose radiotherapy (4 Gy in 1-2 fractions) was 92%. There was no grade 3 toxicity after radiotherapy. Thirty patients were managed without radiotherapy, with excision and observation or steroids.


CONCLUSION
Primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder has excellent outcomes, and management strategies may include observation following biopsy, steroids, or radiation. Ultra-low-dose radiotherapy results in excellent outcomes with limited toxicity and is effective for persistent lesions after steroidal therapy.">

        <tr id="Pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cells are major drivers of autoimmune diseases, yet therapies modulating T cell phenotypes to promote an anti-inflammatory state are lacking. Here, we identify T helper 17 (TH17) cell plasticity in the kidneys of patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated glomerulonephritis on the basis of single-cell (sc) T cell receptor analysis and scRNA velocity. To uncover molecules driving T cell polarization and plasticity, we established an in vivo pooled scCRISPR droplet sequencing (iCROP-seq) screen and applied it to mouse models of glomerulonephritis and colitis. CRISPR-based gene targeting in TH17 cells could be ranked according to the resulting transcriptional perturbations, and polarization biases into T helper 1 (TH1) and regulatory T cells could be quantified. Furthermore, we show that iCROP-seq can facilitate the identification of therapeutic targets by efficient functional stratification of genes and pathways in a disease- and tissue-specific manner. These findings uncover TH17 to TH1 cell plasticity in the human kidney in the context of renal autoimmunity. A single-cell in vivo CRISPR screen highlights genes driving T cell tissue adaptation and plasticity in autoimmunity. Editor’s summary Modulating plasticity in pathogenic T cells to promote a tolerogenic phenotype is a promising therapeutic approach in autoimmunity and cancer. To explore how pathogenic TH17 cell plasticity is regulated in mouse models of kidney and gut inflammation, Enk et al. optimized an in vivo pooled single-cell CRISPR droplet sequencing (iCROP-seq) screen. iCROP-seq enabled the assessment and quantification of CRISPR-modified TH17 cell polarization states in vivo. Furthermore, T cells from patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated glomerulonephritis exhibited plasticity. These findings indicate that iCROP-seq can be applied to preclinical mouse models of inflammation and suggest that targeting TH17 plasticity in patients with ANCA-glomerulonephritis is a promising therapeutic approach. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="Introduction Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (CAR T therapy) is a treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma that has led to unprecedented treatment outcomes. Among CAR T therapies available, ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) is a good candidate for outpatient administration due to its generally predictable safety profile. There are multiple advantages of outpatient administration of cilta-cel, including reduced healthcare burden, expanded access, and patient autonomy. This mixed methods qualitative study aimed to identify key factors for outpatient administration of CAR T and best practice recommendations by combining a targeted literature review with expert interviews and panels. Methods The targeted review (Phase 1) aimed to identify factors for outpatient CAR T administration in the US and determine key topics for the exploratory interviews (Phase 2) and expert panels (Phase 3), which aimed to inform on best practices and challenges of outpatient CAR T administration (focusing on cilta-cel). Participants in clinical and administrative positions based in treatment centers that had experience with real-world outpatient administration of cilta-cel were recruited. Results Seventeen studies were identified in Phase 1. Key factors for outpatient administration included the development of protocols for CAR T complications, education for caregivers, outpatient specialists, hospital staff, and emergency services staff for identification and referral after possible adverse events, the creation of multidisciplinary teams for effective communication and management, straightforward patient intake processes encompassing financial eligibility review and provision of patient education materials, and close patient monitoring throughout the treatment journey. In Phase 2, 5 participants from 2 centers were interviewed. In Phase 3, 14 participants across 6 treatment centers were interviewed. Two 90-minute virtual panel discussions took place. All participants agreed that cilta-cel can be safely and effectively administered in an outpatient setting. Key recommendations included the creation of educational resources for patients and caregivers, the development of standard operating procedures, dedicated outpatient infrastructure and establishment of interdisciplinary teams, outpatient monitoring for toxicity management, and monitoring of the reimbursement landscape. Discussion This study offers a comprehensive understanding of the feasibility of outpatient cilta-cel administration in participating CAR T centers and provides actionable recommendations while acknowledging existing challenges.">

        <tr id="Background One of the first clinical observations of ibrutinib activity in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a rapid decline in lymph nodes size. This phenomenon is accompanied by an hyperlymphocytosis, either transient or prolonged, which is associated with distinct clinical responses and thus has an impact on long-term outcomes. Understanding which factors determine distinct disease courses upon ibrutinib treatment remains a scientific challenge. Methods and findings From 2016 to 2021, we conducted a longitudinal and observational study in 2 cohorts of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (cohort 1, n = 41; cohort 2, n = 81). These cohorts reflect the well-known clinical features of CLL patients, such as Male/Female sex ratio of 2/1, a median age of 70 years at diagnosis, and include patients in first-line therapy (27%) or relapsed/refractory patients (73%). Blood cell counts were followed for each patient during 2 years of ibrutinib treatment. In addition, immunophenotyping and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were assessed in patients from cohort 1. These data were integrated in a newly built mathematical model, inspired by previous mathematical works on CLL treatment and combining dynamical and statistical models, leading to the identification of biological mechanisms associated with the 2 types of clinical responses. This multidisciplinary approach allowed to identify baseline parameters that dictated lymphocytes kinetics upon ibrutinib treatment. Indeed, ibrutinib-induced lymphocytosis defined 2 CLL patient subgroups, transient hyperlymphocytosis (tHL) or prolonged hyperlymphocytosis (pHL), that can be discriminated, before the treatment, by absolute counts of CD4+ T lymphocytes (p = 0.026) and regulatory CD4 T cells (p = 0.007), programmed cell death protein 1 PD1 (p = 0.022) and CD69 (p = 0.03) expression on B leukemic cells, CD19/CD5high/CXCR4low level (p = 0.04), and lymph node cellularity. We also pinpointed that the group of patients identified by the transient hyperlymphocytosis has lower duration response and a poor clinical outcome. The mathematical approach led to the reproduction of patient-specific dynamics and the estimation of associated patient-specific biological parameters, and highlighted that the differences between the 2 groups were mainly due to the production of leukemic B cells in lymph node compartments, and to a lesser extent to T lymphocytes and leukemic B cell egress into bloodstream. Access to additional data, especially longitudinal MRI data, could strengthen the conclusions regarding leukemic B cell dynamics in lymph nodes and the relevance of 2 distinct groups of patients. Conclusions Altogether, our multidisciplinary study provides a better understanding of ibrutinib response and highlights new pharmacodynamic parameters before and along ibrutinib treatment. Since our results highlight a reduced duration response and outcome in patients with transient hyperlymphocytosis, our approach provides support for managing ibrutinib therapy after 3 months of treatment.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The risk of second tumors after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, especially the risk of T-cell neoplasms related to viral vector integration, is an emerging concern.


METHODS
We reviewed our clinical experience with adoptive cellular CAR T-cell therapy at our institution since 2016 and ascertained the occurrence of second tumors. In one case of secondary T-cell lymphoma, a broad array of molecular, genetic, and cellular techniques were used to interrogate the tumor, the CAR T cells, and the normal hematopoietic cells in the patient.


RESULTS
A total of 724 patients who had received T-cell therapies at our center were included in the study. A lethal T-cell lymphoma was identified in a patient who had received axicabtagene ciloleucel therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and both lymphomas were deeply profiled. Each lymphoma had molecularly distinct immunophenotypes and genomic profiles, but both were positive for Epstein-Barr virus and were associated with DNMT3A and TET2 mutant clonal hematopoiesis. No evidence of oncogenic retroviral integration was found with the use of multiple techniques.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results highlight the rarity of second tumors and provide a framework for defining clonal relationships and viral vector monitoring. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others.).">

        <tr id="Immuno-oncology (IO) is a growing strategy in cancer treatment. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) can selectively infect cancer cells and lead to direct and/or immune-dependent tumor lysis. This approach represents an opportunity to potentiate the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as pembrolizumab. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive quantitative models for the aforementioned scenarios. In this work, we developed a mechanistic framework describing viral kinetics, viral dynamics, and tumor response after intratumoral (i.t.) or intravenous (i.v.) administration of V937 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab. The model accounts for tumor shrinkage, in both injected and non-injected lesions, induced by: viral-infected tumor cell death and activated CD8 cells. OV-infected tumor cells enhanced the expansion of CD8 cells, whereas pembrolizumab inhibits their exhaustion by competing with PD-L1 in their binding to PD-1. Circulating viral levels and treatment effects on tumor volume were adequately characterized in all the different scenarios. This mechanistic-based model has been developed by combining top-down and bottom-up approaches and provides individual estimates of viral and ICI responses. The robustness of the model is reflected by the description of the tumor size time profiles in a variety of clinical scenarios. Additionally, this platform allows us to investigate not only the contribution of processes related to the viral kinetics and dynamics on tumor response, but also the influence of its interaction with an ICI. Additionally, the model can be used to explore different scenarios aiming to optimize treatment combinations and support clinical development.">
